  Run unit U2 (Analysis — DIAGNOSE, GATE:HYPOTHESIS) of an AutoFlow cycle

  when the operator starts a U2 session (/autoflow:cycle-u2 <N>).
argument-hint: "<issue-number>"

AutoFlow root (`<autoflow-root>`): ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
An `<autoflow-root>/…` path is under that directory, and `<autoflow-root>` is never typed into a shell; a bare relative path (`.claude/autoflow.local.json`, the target's own files) is the target's, and `<attempt-dir>/…` is in the record directory `autoflow-records dir` prints. Where this line is absent — a helper, a shell — `autoflow-root` prints the root.

**Scope** (`$ARGUMENTS`: `<N>`) — unit U2, Analysis (DIAGNOSE, GATE:HYPOTHESIS), of issue #N's cycle alone: confirm from `bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/preflight/cycle-status.sh --issue <N>` that the cycle stands at U2's entry (otherwise report the situation and stop), run U2 from its entry to its exit transition, and end the session with the report the invoking prompt asks for.

**The core in this body** — the parts of `<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md` that U2 uses, by the classification `<autoflow-root>/scripts/skills/core-units.tsv`. Left out, and read in `<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md` when the work needs one: Development Lifecycle > Flow Control > Any unit: Push and PR creation; Development Lifecycle > Unit Document Loading Contract: U1 Preparation, U3 Design, U4 Build and verify, U5 Completion eval, U6 Delivery, U7 Review; Development Lifecycle > Unit references: U1 Preparation, U3 Design, U4 Build and verify, U5 Completion evaluation, U6 Delivery, U7 Review; Project Information: A project whose information names sub-repos; Team Structure: Build unit (U4); Git Workflow — Rules: PR Wait Rule.

**The documents in this body** — after the core, the documents this session follows, by the classification `<autoflow-root>/scripts/skills/role-docs.tsv`: `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/analysis.md`; `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Functional-unit agents; `<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Reporting Format; `<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Verification and Tools.

## Instruction Conventions

- **`[MUST]`** marks a hard constraint enforced by a gate, hook, or role contract — treat it as a literal, non-negotiable rule, not as emphasis to be generalized to nearby cases. **`[DENY]`** marks a prohibited action.
- These tags carry the weight; do not stack extra emphasis on top of them (no "CRITICAL: you MUST…").
- A `[MUST]` applies exactly to the scope it names. When a rule must hold across every phase, file, or section, the rule states that scope explicitly — an instruction written for one item is not silently generalized to others.

## Rule Scope — Authority Rules and AI Judgment

This section is the single home of the four principles; every other document cites it rather than restating it.

1. **A rule exists only to bind authority and to prevent self-certification.** The push gate, the merge prohibition, the gate score thresholds, the rule that a change to acceptance-criterion content stands only as a recorded `[ac-decision]` ledger entry, and the auto-resolution attempt caps are rules of this kind.
2. **Which route to take, which tests to run, and how far the work reaches are the working AI's judgment**, and the AI records the grounds for each judgment in the report or ledger entry the phase already produces.
3. **A judgment can be wrong.** A wrong judgment is caught by CI, by the external reviewer, and by the gates. When the AI is not confident, or the choice is not its own to make, it asks the advisor, whose answer is recorded and applied; the operator is asked only when a call is blocked at the harness level (`<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Advisor).
4. **A rule and the device that enforces it change in the same change.**

The rules that apply these principles to running and confirming tests and to securing tools — *Local verification*, a run's evidence, how a test is run, the tools the work needs, a missing run, what a cycle leaves in the target's tree — are `<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Verification and Tools.

## Development Lifecycle — AutoFlow

**PREFLIGHT cannot be skipped.** If its completion conditions (prior-cycle resolved, clean Git state, remote sync) are not met, DIAGNOSE does not begin. Resolve the block first and report.

**An attempt's criteria are settled before DIAGNOSE.** Each attempt's cycle begins with its own criterion review stage, against the target's code and policy; its `[criterion-ready]` ledger entry records the settled decisions, and PREFLIGHT reads only that entry for the current issue body (`<autoflow-root>/docs/criterion-review.md`).

### Flow Control

Each unit's rows are its unit document's `## Transitions` section, which the unit's body carries (the router table in *Unit Document Loading Contract* below); the rows that leave no single unit are *Any unit* below.

#### Any unit

| Transition | Condition |
|------|------|
| BUILD / gate recommendation (acceptance-criterion content change) → orchestrator / advisor | the build report raises a change to an acceptance criterion's content, or a gate recommendation records a criterion defect (`<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md` > *A criterion can be wrong*) or its fix needs one → the orchestrator decides it, and puts it to the advisor only where the raised grounds do not settle it or it is not confident. After its `[ac-decision]` entries the cycle re-enters where the orchestrator judges the decision reaches — ARCHITECT, BUILD, or the point the question arose at — consuming no re-entry budget (ARCHITECT > *Report routing*) |
| any phase (tool or referenced material → user) | a harness-level block: the work needs a tool, or a material an acceptance criterion or the issue body references, that neither this environment nor a procedure in the target's documents or scripts can provide — or needs, for a tool the environment has, what using it lacks (access, a purpose and permitted scope, a credential, a permission setting); the request names what is missing, never the tool's output → report situation-first, `active:false`, `phase:"awaiting-user"`. The answer is an `O` ledger entry with the authority `operator decision`; the cycle resumes where it paused, or at an ARCHITECT unit re-run when a verification-design row must change, consuming no re-entry budget (`<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Verification and Tools > *The tools the work needs*; ARCHITECT > *Tools*) |
| GATE:HYPOTHESIS / GATE:PLAN / AUDIT / GATE:QUALITY (PASS, a recommendation attempt) → doc commit / BUILD / ARCHITECT / DIAGNOSE → that gate's re-score, or → advisor / user | the PASS report's recommendation triage opens an attempt → the transition out of the gate waits until no attempt is open and no rebuttal awaits its re-score; a pause criterion, or a rebutted recommendation the re-score keeps while the two sides still disagree → the advisor decides; the attempt cap → user (`active:false`, `phase:"awaiting-user"`) (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/completion-evaluation.md` > *Recommendation triage*) |

**Regressions** (cap semantics: "max N×" = N regressions permitted; the gate escalates to a human on the **(N+1)th** FAIL — e.g. `max 2×` → escalate on the 3rd FAIL): GATE:HYPOTHESIS FAIL → a re-entry the orchestrator judges (no count cap; a PASS judged unreachable → not reachable: the operator confirms the close). GATE:PLAN FAIL → ARCHITECT (max 3×; a BUILD design contradiction re-run consumes this same counter, so ARCHITECT re-entries are capped at 3 per cycle regardless of which phase triggered them; a unit re-run on an advisor answer to the unit's own `## Decision requests` is not a re-entry and consumes no counter — an acceptance-criterion decision is an authority checkpoint inside the design, not a new one — and a return to ARCHITECT that an `[ac-decision]` raised after ARCHITECT calls for consumes none either, and neither does one that the operator's answer to a tool or referenced-material request, or an operator override of an advisor decision, calls for; a return to ARCHITECT to fix a gate recommendation does consume it). AUDIT test-first finding and AUDIT FAIL → a BUILD unit re-run (max 2×, one counter shared by both; how the unit iterates inside a run is its own and is recorded in its report). GATE:QUALITY FAIL → class-routed re-entry (doc commit / BUILD / ARCHITECT by `remedy_class`; max 3× — the cap counts FAILs, not the distance re-entered; a `design` route also consumes the ARCHITECT re-entry counter above). A recommendation attempt at any rubric-scored gate is not a FAIL and consumes no FAIL cap: max 7× on its own window, counted as `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/completion-evaluation.md` > *Recommendation triage* says; a re-score that fails is an ordinary FAIL. INTEGRATE FAIL → BUILD (`impl`). HANDOFF failure → cause classification: CI failure → class-routed re-entry by `remedy_class` (a `design` route consumes the ARCHITECT re-entry counter); environment / push rejection → HANDOFF internal retry (max 2×). reviewer-review auto-resolution (Medium+ found at REVIEW) → class-routed re-entry, at the depth the route's recorded judgment names (max 7× — the cap counts attempts, not the distance re-entered, so a thin route consumes one exactly as a re-entry from DIAGNOSE does; on the 7th consecutive (per the count window in `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/review.md` > *Routing*) without the verdict falling below Medium, pause for the user).
**Human escalation**: a gate's own regression cap exhausted without a pass (each gate's cap is the "max N×" on the Regressions line above, which fixes the escalation timing — this is **per-gate**, not a cross-gate running total); GATE:HYPOTHESIS has no count cap — the recorded judgment that its PASS is not reachable is its escalation. HANDOFF internal retry exhausted → human. A harness-level block → human.
**Advisor at a decision point** (ADR-0025 D7): every Flow Control row that routes to the advisor — the rows above and each unit document's `## Transitions` rows — is a decision point — a fresh `autoflow-advisor` answers, its answer is recorded as an `A` ledger entry and applied, and the cycle continues without pausing. The operator stops the forward path only at a harness-level block — a permission denial, a tool, credential or material the environment does not provide, or what using a tool it has lacks (a review-infrastructure failure the reviewer re-run does not clear is one); PREFLIGHT's fail-closed readiness stop is an independent check, not a decision point. An operator override of a recorded decision is an `O` entry under `operator decision`. Procedure and independence: `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Advisor.
**Phase scripts** (ADR-0025 D8): a script AutoFlow ships for a phase reads and reports; it changes nothing in git, on GitHub or in the cycle's state — every such change is the orchestrator's own.

### Unit Document Loading Contract

**[MUST]** On entering a phase, act on the document of its unit below, which the session's command body carries after the core (*Context Injection*), **before** acting in that phase. The unit document is the source of truth for that unit's body; this core file does not restate it. Do not execute a phase from memory of a prior cycle — the body is the unit document of the installed version.

| Unit | Phases | Unit document | Exit |
|------|--------|------|------|
| U1 Preparation | PREFLIGHT, CRITERION-REVIEW | `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/preparation.md` | PREFLIGHT's readiness conditions |
| U2 Analysis | DIAGNOSE, GATE:HYPOTHESIS | `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/analysis.md` | GATE:HYPOTHESIS |
| U3 Design | ARCHITECT, GATE:PLAN | `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/design.md` | GATE:PLAN |
| U4 Build and verify | BUILD, AUDIT | `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/build.md` | AUDIT |
| U5 Completion evaluation | GATE:QUALITY | `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/completion-evaluation.md` | GATE:QUALITY |
| U6 Delivery | DELIVER, INTEGRATE, HANDOFF | `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/delivery.md` | HANDOFF: every pull request open, CI green or recorded as not run |
| U7 Review | REVIEW | `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/review.md` | REVIEW: the aggregated review below Medium, CI green or recorded as not run |

What each phase does, and what else a unit's body carries: the phase list and *Unit references* below.

The gate **PASS thresholds** (each ≥ 7, avg ≥ 7.5, security ≤ 3 → immediate block) and the **regression / retry caps** are fixed invariants: they live in the Flow Control table and the **Regressions** line above, and the unit documents and rubrics apply them. Who enforces what: the hook (`<autoflow-root>/hooks/check-autoflow-gate.sh`) computes PASS from the recorded `scores` — for the score-gated role spawns, `git push` and `gh pr create` — and denies `git push` / `gh pr create` while the `audit` or `gate_quality` record carries `remedy_class`; it counts no FAIL. The FAIL and re-entry counts are the orchestrator's own accounting, and the REVIEW auto-resolution count is `<autoflow-root>/scripts/handoff/review-gate.sh`'s (exit `11` at 7).

When the user files an issue, the flow below executes in order. Each phase auto-transitions when its completion conditions are met. The flow only stops to wait for human input at the points explicitly marked.

Seven functional units carry the phases (`ADR-0025` D1, `ADR-0033`). A unit is the unit of prescription — its goal, artifact contract, verification and loop cap — and each has one document (*Unit Document Loading Contract* above). The phase and gate names stay: they are the identifiers the state keys, the ledger headings, the spawn-policy keys and the hook messages carry.

```
U2 Analysis            DIAGNOSE        — one `autoflow-unit-analysis` spawn writes the analysis report: current structure, the gap to the request, whether a change is owed and code is the lever (the conclusion), the cause where a defect is reported, acceptance-criterion table, scope judgments, affected docs, decision points — each conclusion with its grounds, its method (how far and by what means a cause is pursued included) its own
                       GATE:HYPOTHESIS — one Evaluation AI: one form for every issue (2 items × 10 points — the conclusion's grounds and the goal's coverage)
```

**Flow Control** — the transitions, grouped by the unit they leave. Each group's unit document is the home of the
procedure a row names; the row keeps the condition and the destination.

Each unit's body — what it is asked, its artifact contract, its cautions, its routing and its unit-local `[MUST]`/`[DENY]` constraints — lives in its **unit document**, not in this core file. This file retains what crosses a unit's boundary: the cross-unit invariants and authority rules, the router (the unit and phase list and the Flow Control table above, whose per-unit rows are each unit document's `## Transitions` section), the regression / escalation caps (above), the Execution Principles, and the state rules (below; the state file's schema and the hook gates are `<autoflow-root>/docs/state-tracking.md`). Not every part binds every unit: a session that runs one unit receives the parts its unit uses, by the classification `<autoflow-root>/scripts/skills/core-units.tsv`, and a session that runs the whole cycle receives all of it; each receives the documents its units use with them (*Context Injection*).

The rubric of every gate — GATE:HYPOTHESIS, GATE:PLAN, AUDIT and GATE:QUALITY — is the evaluator's, not the unit's: it lives in `<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md` > *Gate rubrics*, and the unit document routes the gate's result.

The evaluation contract (fresh-spawn Evaluation AI, the evaluator's standard, the 10-point scale, the output format) lives in `<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md`; how the orchestrator spawns and prompts the evaluator is `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Evaluation AI.

## Cost Control

These rules apply to every cycle.

- **[MUST] Orchestrator context discipline**: two rows are fixed (Rule Scope, principle 1): (1) **the orchestrator never scores what a gate scores** — the full read-and-score of a gate's artifact set is the fresh Evaluation AI's (GATE:HYPOTHESIS, GATE:PLAN, AUDIT, GATE:QUALITY), and an orchestrator read of those artifacts informs a spot-check, never a verdict; (2) **the orchestrator never receives a unit's body** — the DIAGNOSE, ARCHITECT and BUILD units return only their artifact paths and a one-line summary. What the orchestrator reads directly is its own judgment, recorded with its grounds in the report or ledger entry the phase already produces (Rule Scope, principle 2). A cheap anchor-check — a `git show <SHA>`, the summary line read in a cited log, a targeted `git show HEAD:<file>` of the specific lines (see Execution Principles > Verify role-spawn claims) — needs no recorded ground; a completed artifact — a single report, a design document — may be read in full when the orchestrator judges the read necessary, and the entry names what was read and why. The Reporting Format (`<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Reporting Format) applies to every direct/ad-hoc `Agent` spawn, scripted-phase or not — the spawn writes its body to `<attempt-dir>/*` and returns only an anchor + one-line summary (e.g. the DIAGNOSE unit writes `<attempt-dir>/issue-N-analysis.md` and returns a summary, not the body), and a multi-step investigation is delegated to a role spawn or research subagent on the same terms; the orchestrator's judgment is over what it then reads of that body, not over what a spawn sends back. The "anchor + one-line summary" rule bounds what a spawn **returns**; it does not set how a **human decision** is framed — a user-facing pause follows *Execution Principles > Human-decision presentation* (situation-first), and the `<attempt-dir>/*` body the user reads is written in that order.
- **Concurrent spawns**: keep ≤ 5 `Agent` spawns in flight at once.

## Decision Ledger

A per-attempt append-only record, `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-ledger.md`, fixes settled decisions. What an entry records, its identifier grammar, and the decision-point entries — the advisor's first judgment and the operator's override (`[ac-decision]`, `[checklist-decision]`) — are `<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md`.

- **[MUST]** A recorded decision is not re-litigated without a **new verified fact** — a fact unavailable when the entry was written and deterministically checkable (a commit SHA, a `Tests: N passed` line, a `file:line` content read at a named commit), not a re-reading or re-interpretation of material already on the record. A settled gate verdict is likewise not overturned by re-reading the issue body. Two exceptions: a verified error in the record itself (`<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md` > Entries), and an operator's override of an advisor decision, whose ground is the operator's authority (`<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md` > *Advisor decisions and operator overrides*).
- **[MUST]** The ledger is append-only: entries are never edited or deleted. A superseding decision adds a new entry that cites the new fact — or, under the verified-error exception, the reproduced error — and references the entry it supersedes.
- The ledger is outside every role spawn's scope — it is host-owned, written only by the orchestrator and the advisor (what each appends: `<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md` > Entries > *Writers*). **[MUST]** Only the advisor adds the authority `advisor decision` or an `A<n>` entry; only the main session adds `operator decision` or an `O<n>` entry; the advisor never adds an `O` / `F` / `E` entry; and a write never changes text already in the ledger — enforced by the gate hook (`<autoflow-root>/docs/state-tracking.md` > Hook gates).
- **[MUST]** `bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/ledger/ledger-entry-id.sh next <ledger> <NS>` allocates every identifier, and is called immediately before that entry's own append — one call per entry, never a serial incremented locally across a batch. It derives the serial from the file on disk and from the identifiers already reserved, and reserves the one it prints, so writers of one namespace that allocate concurrently — advisors spawned together — receive distinct identifiers (`<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md` > Entry identifier > *Allocation*).
- The gate hook runs `bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/ledger/ledger-entry-id.sh check <ledger>` as a **non-gating advisory** over changed ledgers: `check` exits 1 on a duplicated identifier or an unidentified level-2 heading, 2 on a usage error, and the hook warns — to the model as `additionalContext` on a call it admits — and never denies a tool call over a ledger defect. A defect cannot be removed from an append-only ledger; what the writer does about one is its judgment, recorded as a new entry (Rule Scope, principle 2), and a citation of a shared identifier is read as `<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md` > Entry identifier > *Identifier collision* says.

## Execution Principles

- **[MUST] Human-decision presentation**: when a phase pauses to ask the human for a decision or answer — `AskUserQuestion`, or a "report to user + pause" exit (a harness-level block such as a tool or referenced-material request, a cap reached, a cycle the advisor ended at DIAGNOSE or GATE:HYPOTHESIS) — and in every advisor request and advisor answer record (`<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Advisor), the presentation is **situation-first**, in this order: ① the situation in domain / behavior terms — what is wrong or being decided, and for whom (e.g. "auth state is not retained across pages from the user's entry point", **not** "module A's anchor-format constraint at the A↔B↔C consistency boundary"); ② the decision being asked, plus each option and what it changes; ③ anchors demoted to supporting evidence for drill-down, never the lead — a commit SHA with `path:line` for a fact of this tree, or the document, section heading and quoted sentence for a provision of a long-lived document. This register is distinct from the machine **Reporting Format** (`<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Reporting Format), which is anchor-first. The `<attempt-dir>/*` body the user is pointed to is written in this same situation-first order — *Orchestrator context discipline*'s "anchor + one-line summary" governs what a spawn **returns**, not how a human decision is **framed**.
- **Verify role-spawn claims before dispatch**: every role-spawn report's Evidence anchor (see `<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Reporting Format item 5) is verified before ACCEPT — `git show <SHA>` for a commit anchor, the summary line read in the cited log for a test-pass anchor (the command is re-run only when the log is absent or does not carry that line, and the run is then `not-run` and run in place — `<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Verification and Tools > *A run's evidence is the log it left*), `git show <SHA>:<file>` at the report's commit for a file-state anchor (a `path:line` is read only at the commit the report names), the result line read in the cited observation record for an observation anchor (`<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Verification and Tools > *The tools the work needs*). **An anchor-less report is rejected, not interpreted.** Do not dispatch based on a single AI's unverified claim.
- **Safety first**: accurate flow execution beats fast response. Accuracy over speed.
- **Verify before transition**: re-confirm completion conditions before moving on.
- **The route is the AI's judgment; the independent checks are not** (Rule Scope, principles 1–3): which work phases a change passes through and how deep each goes — DIAGNOSE's analysis, ARCHITECT's design, BUILD's execution, INTEGRATE's bundle — is the working AI's judgment, recorded with its grounds in the ledger entry or phase report that phase already produces. What is never skipped is an independent check, an authority rule under principle 1: PREFLIGHT's readiness conditions, the gate score thresholds (GATE:HYPOTHESIS, GATE:PLAN, AUDIT, GATE:QUALITY), the `git push` / `gh pr create` gate, CI (its result as it is: green, or, where the target's CI does not run for the pull request, that recorded on it — never read as green), the aggregated review and its verdict, and the auto-resolution attempt caps. The hook keeps the two apart structurally: a role spawn is admitted only on the recorded PASS of the gate that precedes it, so a phase whose artifact a gate scores runs at least far enough to produce that artifact, and a skipped phase never skips a gate.
- **Role-spawn idle handling**: a task notification signals only that a spawn finished; it does not require a response, and it is not itself the report. Continue work when (a) a spawn returns an actionable report — its return value — (b) a Bash result you initiated returns, or (c) the user types a new prompt. When a **Done** direct-spawn produces no report, do not wait for a follow-up: verify its `<attempt-dir>/*` artifact by shell and proceed (see "Incomplete output is never ground truth").
- **Background execution is orchestrator-only**: the `run_in_background` + wait-for-completion-notification pattern is available **only** to the orchestrator (the main loop), and every role spawn's Bash runs foreground-only; the binding rule lives in `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-common-rules.md` > Bash Execution Mode.
- **[MUST] Wait discipline (orchestrator)**: the orchestrator waits for a subagent, a `Workflow`, or a backgrounded Bash task by **ending its turn** — the harness re-invokes the session with a task notification when the task completes, and other tasks' notifications and the user's prompts are delivered in between. A **blocking wait** — a foreground `sleep` loop polling for a result — is not used. A polling wait is reserved for external state the harness cannot notify about (a CI run, a remote queue), and even then a bounded one; a task the harness tracks is never polled. One timer is admitted beside that wait, the **cache keep-alive wake**: a running task keeps its own prompt cache warm through its own requests, while the orchestrator sends none, so a wait longer than the prompt-cache TTL expires the orchestrator's cached context and its first turn after the notification re-writes all of it. While a tracked task runs, the orchestrator therefore may arm one backgrounded `sleep` shorter than that TTL (`run_in_background`; 50 minutes at the 1-hour TTL) and end its turn. The turn the timer wakes is not a poll: it reads no transcript or output file of the task — only a cheap anchor-check (a log's modification time, `git log -1`) — re-arms the timer and ends the turn, and the timer is stopped once the task's notification arrives. What the wake observes about the task's progress, and any decision drawn from it, is the orchestrator's judgment, recorded with its grounds in the report or ledger entry the phase already produces. The "no turn ends before the work is done" instruction is satisfied by the re-entry — the turn that ends on a pending notification is not an abandonment, the harness resumes it.
- **[DENY]** **mailbox-delivery instruction in a spawn prompt**: a prompt must never instruct a spawn to deliver its result by message to the orchestrator. A spawn prompt states the delivery action as "return … as your report", naming no carrier: the harness picks the carrier by permission mode, and in auto mode a spawn's final plain text is not delivered. There is one delivery path, and it is the return value; what carries a spawn's report is `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-common-rules.md` > Result delivery path by spawn mode.
- **Incomplete output is never ground truth**: a 1-line tool result such as a Read-dedup stub (`file unchanged … refer to that earlier tool_result`) is a harness artifact, not data. Never conclude "absent / empty / stub" or escalate a blocker from one; re-read via shell (`sed -n`/`grep`/`wc -l`) and reproduce the finding before acting. Address another directory with `git -C <path>` + absolute paths rather than a `cd`-prefixed compound, which can raise a permission prompt. The `Read` PostToolUse hook (`<autoflow-root>/hooks/check-read-dedup.sh`) flags the dedup case at runtime; the U2 unit document (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/analysis.md` > Spot-check & escalation discipline) carries the full procedure.
- **Stop on error**: do not act on errors or omissions until the situation is fully understood.
- **[MUST] Ground every proposal**: present each proposal — especially a post-completion follow-up (new issue, follow-on work, improvement) — together with the sufficient grounds that support it (a verified fact, a reproducible observation, or a stated design judgment).
- **[MUST] File every issue through the wrapper**: `gh issue create` (and its REST form) is denied at the tool boundary. An issue is filed by writing a draft to `<drafts>/<name>.md` (`<drafts>` is what `autoflow-records drafts` prints) per `<autoflow-root>/docs/issue-proposal.md` and running `<autoflow-root>/scripts/issue/create-issue.sh --draft <drafts>/<name>.md`, which re-runs the duplicate search from the draft's own title. A report of having searched neither substitutes for the search nor narrows it. Keep the wrapper off every permission allow-list.
- **[MUST] Check cross-issue consistency before an added proposal**: before raising an additional follow-up, confirm whether it duplicates or conflicts with the other issues that already exist (open and closed, plus the cycle's tracking hub), and carry that confirmation into the proposal's grounds.

## Spawn Model — Phase-by-Phase

AutoFlow role spawns and every other subagent spawn choose the model by phase work type rather than inheriting the host session model.

The per-phase assignment itself — every phase's `model`, its `effort`, and the work type that
justifies it — lives in exactly ONE machine-readable place and is **not** restated here:

**`.claude/autoflow/spawn-policy.json`**, read through `<autoflow-root>/scripts/spawn-policy/spawn-policy.sh`:

```
bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/spawn-policy/spawn-policy.sh model  <phase-key>   # the model to declare on the spawn
bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/spawn-policy/spawn-policy.sh effort <phase-key>   # the effort, or the config's own inherit sentinel
bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/spawn-policy/spawn-policy.sh check                # validate the config
```

**[MUST]** Every `Agent` spawn declares the `model` parameter explicitly (`model: "sonnet"` or `model: "opus"`). Enforced by the hook (`<autoflow-root>/hooks/check-autoflow-gate.sh`, PreToolUse `Agent`): a spawn without `model` is denied, independent of Auto-Flow state — research and evaluation spawns included. The orchestrator's own model follows the user's session settings (outside this policy).

**[MUST]** The value a spawn declares is **resolved by running the readout**, never recalled from a table or from memory of a prior cycle: `bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/spawn-policy/spawn-policy.sh model <phase-key>`. Editing one config row is therefore the whole of a policy change — no other file is touched. The hook additionally emits a non-gating advisory when a declared `model` falls outside the set the config admits for that `subagent_type`; it warns and never denies.

**[MUST] Spawn role declaration**: every `Agent` spawn made while an AutoFlow cycle is active (`active:true` state file present) declares its **role structurally** — every spawn uses a dedicated `subagent_type` (`autoflow-analyzer` / `autoflow-evaluator` / `autoflow-advisor`, the criterion-review agents `autoflow-criterion-tracer` / `autoflow-criterion-analyzer` / `autoflow-criterion-reconciler`, and the functional-unit agents `autoflow-unit-analysis` / `autoflow-unit-design` / `autoflow-unit-build`, defined in `<autoflow-root>/agents/`); the built-in research types (`Explore` / `Plan` / `claude-code-guide`) count as declared. `subagent_type` is the sole declaration channel. The hook owns the role→gate mapping (analysis — the criterion-review agents and `autoflow-unit-analysis` included — / evaluation / advisor / research pass; planning — `autoflow-unit-design`, the ARCHITECT unit → GATE:HYPOTHESIS; implementation — `autoflow-unit-build`, the BUILD unit → GATE:PLAN) and **denies an undeclared spawn while a cycle is active**. The spawn prompt is never used to infer the spawn's class. A spawn declares **who it is**; it never declares which gate applies to it. See `<autoflow-root>/docs/gate-matching-standard.md` > P3. Every role's spawn mode is fixed by the `[MUST]` below.

**[MUST] A unit agent's spawns inherit its gate class** (ADR-0025 D5): a spawn whose caller — the hook input's `agent_type` — is a functional-unit agent needs no role declaration and is judged by that unit's gate class; a declared role that has a gate of its own keeps it as well, so an existing role type is never judged more loosely because a unit spawned it. The caller is the immediate one. The explicit-`model` rule above holds for these spawns too. The unit agents and the advisor are defined in the common frame (#372); each unit is wired into the lifecycle by its own migration step (ADR-0025 D9) — U2 Analysis runs DIAGNOSE, U3 Design runs ARCHITECT, U4 Build and verify runs BUILD (`<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Functional-unit agents).

**[MUST]** Every role is an **anonymous direct spawn**. No role holds a lifetime spanning phases or cycles: each phase spawns its role fresh, hands it `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-*.md` paths, and takes its result as the spawn's return value. Each role's mode and per-call scope are `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Spawn mode by role lifetime.

**[MUST]** A lower-tier gate's PASS, or a lower-tier role spawn's phase-exit claim, materially contradicted within the same cycle reverts that phase to the higher tier, updating `.claude/autoflow/spawn-policy.json` in the same commit; the contradicting signals and their evidence anchor are `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Model tier revert, which a change to the per-phase assignment also follows.

## Context Injection — Role-Scoped Document Routing

**[MUST]** Subagent document injection is role-scoped, not shared context. A role's guidance — the parts of this core it uses and the documents its work follows — is carried by the carrier the role starts with, from the start: a session's command body, a subagent's agent definition, a reviewer's rule file, which its wrapper's prompt carries. `<autoflow-root>/scripts/skills/gen-skill-bodies.sh` generates each carrier from the guidance's homes — a command body's core parts by `<autoflow-root>/scripts/skills/core-units.tsv`, and every carrier's documents, an agent definition's core parts with them, by `<autoflow-root>/scripts/skills/role-docs.tsv` — so a role's first run and every re-run carry the same guidance. No document is injected wholesale as common context to every spawn; `<autoflow-root>/docs/INDEX.md` routes the usage documents beyond a role's guidance.

A spawn prompt names the cycle's inputs by path — the attempt's artifacts and the target's files — as its unit document's Unit spawn section says, and copies no guidance its carrier carries. A spawn with no AutoFlow definition — a unit's `general-purpose` helper, a research type, an ad-hoc spawn — receives the text of the rules its work follows in the prompt its spawner writes, from the spawner's own carrier. What a role reads beyond its guidance and its inputs is its own judgment.

## Communication

Communication with a role spawn is the `Agent` call itself:
the orchestrator spawns each role with a `subagent_type`, and the spawn's **return value is its
report**.

- The orchestrator spawns each role via `Agent` with `subagent_type: autoflow-<role>` and an explicit `model`; at ARCHITECT that is one `autoflow-unit-design` spawn.
- A spawn writes any body to `<attempt-dir>/*` and returns an anchor + one-line summary (`<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Reporting Format).
- No team is created and no spawn carries `team_name` or `name` — a functional-unit agent's own helper spawns excepted, which are its method (ADR-0025 D2; `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Functional-unit agents). `SendMessage` is not an orchestrator channel — the orchestrator resumes no role by its agent ID (a functional-unit agent's use of it with its own helpers is its method), and it is never a report channel (a spawn's carrier: `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-common-rules.md` > Result delivery path by spawn mode). A project with sub-repos that needs another cross-service coordination takes it up through a new ADR, not through `SendMessage`.
- MCP coord is auxiliary, used for asynchronous logging and handoff.

## Cross-Project Boundary Rules

- **[MUST]** All AIs: modifications outside the assigned scope are not allowed. *Secondary (multi-repo):* in a project with sub-repos, all AIs additionally have read access to the other sub-repositories.
- The orchestrator's "own scope" is the host repository — typically `docker-compose.*`, `platform.sh` (or its analogue), `scripts/`, `.env.*`, `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- A role spawn's "own scope" is the **target scope** it is assigned (the target repo/directory that owns the source). *Secondary (multi-repo):* in a project with sub-repos, that target scope is the sub-repo's directory.
- Cross-service changes are coordinated by the orchestrator, which spawns each scope's role directly and reconciles their returned reports.

For details, see `<autoflow-root>/docs/repo-boundary-rules.md`.

## Project Information

AutoFlow does not classify a project's repository structure and keeps no file of project facts. When work on a repository starts, the AI reads the project's own information and rule files where they exist — a `README.md`, a `CLAUDE.local.md`, or whatever the project keeps — for the facts the work needs, such as how the repositories are composed (a host and its sub-repos, forks and upstreams) and where issues are filed. The operator writes those files while setting up the project, and they may already exist. A fact the work needs that no such file states is asked of the operator in conversation, with the request that the operator create the file or record the fact in it.

## Team Structure

각 역할의 상세 계약은 `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md`를 참조한다.

### AI Orchestrator (host repo)
- Does not write code directly; coordinates role spawns.
- Issue analysis, plan synthesis, role assignment, PR management, integration verification.
- Exception: project rules/configuration, infrastructure, and bulk documentation updates may be committed by the orchestrator directly, as may the fix of a comment's divergence or disallowed content in a target's code (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/completion-evaluation.md` > *Code comments in a target*).

### Evaluation AI — contract: `<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md`; spawn and prompt: `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Evaluation AI
### Advisor — contract: `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Advisor
### Functional-unit agents (U2 / U3 / U4) — contract: `<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Functional-unit agents

## AutoFlow State Tracking (Hook integration)

Every record of an attempt — one run of an issue, keyed by its dev branch — lives in the attempt's record directory `<attempt-dir>`, which `autoflow-records dir` prints for the checked-out dev branch: `<record-root>/<repo-key>/<stamp>-issue-<N>/`, under the record root outside every checkout's tree (default `~/.autoflow`; the operator's `~/.autoflow/config.json` > `record_root`). While the attempt runs, its state file is there; the hook computes pass/fail directly from `scores` to enforce gates.

The state file's naming, its schema and fields, the hook gates and the state at completion are `<autoflow-root>/docs/state-tracking.md`.

**`verdict` rule** (gate_hypothesis only; it carries the bug signal the hook reads — the form itself is the same for every issue; when each value is set follows the Flow Control table):

| Issue type | `verdict` value |
|------------|-----------------|
| Bug / incident | `"pending"`, then `"evaluated"` once the form is scored |
| Non-bug (feat, chore, docs, refactor, …) | `"skipped (non-bug issue)"` |

The hook's state-file validator admits exactly these values, an empty or absent `verdict`, and `"skipped (feat issue)"` — the value a non-bug cycle recorded before `"skipped (non-bug issue)"`, admitted so such a state file stays valid and never written by a new cycle. Any other value makes the state file malformed, and every score-gated `git push` / `gh pr create` / gated `Agent` spawn fails closed until it is repaired. If `verdict` is empty or one of the two `skipped` values, the hook does not gate the ARCHITECT spawn on the `gate_hypothesis` scores; the orchestrator still judges the PASS. Bug issues must be initialised as `"pending"`.

**Score recording**: the orchestrator copies the `scores` object of the Evaluation AI's report into the state file verbatim. The evaluator's own documents fix that object's shape (`<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md` > Evaluation Output Format), so an evaluator prompt does not restate it (`<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md` > Evaluation AI Prompt Rules, rule 2). Each item's score is a number in `0`–`10`, bare or as an object's `score` — shown below; the two shapes may be mixed within one gate. A prose string such as `"9 - reason"` is **not** a score: the hook's state-file validator rejects it, and every score-gated `git push` / `gh pr create` / gated `Agent` spawn fails closed until the file is repaired.

<!-- SCORE-SHAPE-EXAMPLE -->
```json
{ "decision_grounds": { "score": 9, "reason": "evidence" }, "scope": 8 }
```

This object is the value of `phases.<gate>.scores` in `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}.json`.

**Remedy class recording** (a GATE:QUALITY FAIL, an open recommendation attempt at any gate — what opens one is `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/completion-evaluation.md` > *Recommendation triage* — and an open REVIEW review-triage `design` attempt, recorded at `gate_quality` — `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/review.md` > *Routing*): the orchestrator writes the routed class — the farthest of the classes the route was computed from, or `operator` — as `phases.<gate>.remedy_class` (a sibling of `evaluator` and `scores` inside the phase object, the one additive placement the validator admits; never top-level, never inside `scores`). The value is **removed** once the re-score PASSes and no attempt is left open, or is left behind by a later cycle's record of that gate. The hook reads `gate_quality`'s value for the `git commit` gate (`<autoflow-root>/docs/state-tracking.md` > Hook gates), and the presence of a value at `audit` or `gate_quality` for the `git push` / `gh pr create` gates — an open re-entry is not pushed past (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/completion-evaluation.md` > *Recommendation triage*).

## Git Workflow — Rules

> **Procedural details (bash, branch structure, dev cycle)**: `<autoflow-root>/docs/git-workflow.md`

### Commit Rules

```
<type>(#<issue>): <description>

Next: <next action>
```

`type`: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`.

Attribution lines (such as `Co-Authored-By`) are not part of the AutoFlow commit format; whether a commit or PR carries one follows the execution environment (harness) and the operator's settings.

- No direct commits to main — always branch + PR.
- No `feat`/`fix` commit while tests fail → use `wip`.
- `git status` before every commit.
- **[MUST]** Before committing, the committing role — every role that commits, the orchestrator included — runs the target repository's own lint chain over the staged files and confirms zero errors attributable to them. Elaboration (identifying the chains, execution trust boundary, scoping, outcome vocabulary, evidence anchor): `<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md` > Change Surface Rules > *Lint chain on the staged surface*.

### Commit Ownership

| Work type | Committer | PR opener |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Feature (implementation and tests, sub-repo) | Build unit (U4) of that scope | Orchestrator |
| Rules / config / infra / bulk docs | Orchestrator                      | Orchestrator |
| Comment divergence fix (target code) | Orchestrator (sub-repo: the build unit of that scope) | Orchestrator |
| Sub-repo pointer (gitlink) commit or reconcile merge | Orchestrator  | Orchestrator |

# U2 Analysis — DIAGNOSE and GATE:HYPOTHESIS

> Unit document for U2. [`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Unit Document Loading Contract routes to
> this file; the other units are listed in [`autoflow-guide.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/autoflow-guide.md) > Unit
> Documents.

DIAGNOSE and GATE:HYPOTHESIS are one functional unit, U2 Analysis
([`ADR-0025`](<autoflow-root>/docs/records/adr/0025-outcome-gated-functional-units.md) D1). The unit is prescribed by
four things only — its goal, its artifact contract, its verification and its loop cap (D2) — and
this file states them, with the cautions the analysis is asked to heed and the result it owes. How
the unit reaches the goal — what else it reads and in what order, whether it spawns helpers and what it
gives each, how it keeps the cautions — is the unit agent's, recorded with its grounds in its
artifact ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Rule Scope, principle 2).

- **Goal**: the request that triggered the cycle is understood well enough for GATE:HYPOTHESIS to
  score it — the affected structure as it stands, the gap between it and the requested behavior,
  whether a change is owed and whether code is the lever, and the decision points, each conclusion
  with its grounds.
- **Artifact contract**: the analysis report (*Analysis report* below).
- **Verification**: GATE:HYPOTHESIS — a fresh Evaluation AI scores the report on one form for
  every issue, the rubric of [`evaluation-system.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md) > *Gate rubrics* >
  GATE:HYPOTHESIS: whether the report's conclusion is supported by its grounds and whether the
  analysis met its goal. The unit never scores its own artifact. U2 ends at a `gate_hypothesis`
  PASS (*Verification — GATE:HYPOTHESIS* below).
- **Loop cap**: none counted (issue #421). After a FAIL, what follows is the orchestrator's
  judgment, and the cycle leaves GATE:HYPOTHESIS only on a PASS; a PASS judged unreachable goes, on
  that recorded judgment, to the operator (*Verification — GATE:HYPOTHESIS* below).
- **Result owed**: the report's path and a one-line summary that names any decision point it
  recorded ([`submodule-common-rules.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md) > Reporting Format). The
  orchestrator does not receive the report's body.

## Transitions

The Flow Control rows that leave this unit; the rows that leave no single unit, and the regression and escalation caps, are [`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Flow Control.

| Transition | Condition |
|------|------|
| DIAGNOSE (prerequisite) → orchestrator / advisor | `mode=new-issue` only. The analysis report's `## Decision points` records that a planning/design/ADR prerequisite is clearly required first → the orchestrator decides it on the report's grounds, the advisor where they do not settle it or it is not confident: proceed → GATE:HYPOTHESIS (after a U2 re-run where the analysis stopped at the prerequisite); the prerequisite comes first → the cycle ends with the analysis report (`active:false`, `phase:"awaiting-user"`) — a new issue is filed only on the operator's request; when in doubt, no prerequisite is recorded (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/analysis.md` > *Report routing*) |
| DIAGNOSE → GATE:HYPOTHESIS | the U2 unit returned, its analysis report carries every required section, and it records no prerequisite (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/analysis.md` > Unit spawn) |
| GATE:HYPOTHESIS (PASS, `no change needed`) → close / reply / rebuttal | the report concludes the as-is already satisfies the request or nothing is left to do → how the cycle answers it (an already-resolved issue closed, an open PR replied on, a reviewer finding rebutted) is the orchestrator's judgment over the situation, recorded in the ledger (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/analysis.md` > *Verification — GATE:HYPOTHESIS*) |
| review-response (a repeated complaint) → orchestrator / advisor | whoever reads a reviewer finding — the REVIEW aggregator, or the DIAGNOSE unit — sees it repeat the previous attempt's complaint with a new witness case and records that → the orchestrator decides the re-entry (its depth, or none), the advisor where the grounds do not settle it or it is not confident. No spawn checks for it on every attempt (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/review.md` > *A repeated complaint*) |
| GATE:HYPOTHESIS → ARCHITECT | PASS + the report concludes `code change` + its recommendations triaged (no attempt open); the hook gates the spawn on the recorded PASS for a bug / incident issue, and `verdict` `skipped (non-bug issue)` admits it for any other |
| GATE:HYPOTHESIS (PASS, `non-code lever`) → orchestrator / advisor | a real gap whose lever is data / configuration / operations → the orchestrator decides it on the report's grounds, the advisor where they do not settle it or it is not confident: a code change is still owed → ARCHITECT; the lever is non-code → the cycle ends with its report (`active:false`, `phase:"awaiting-user"`) |
| GATE:HYPOTHESIS (FAIL) → DIAGNOSE | the re-entry is the orchestrator's judgment over the evaluator's findings, recorded in the ledger — a U2 unit re-run; no count cap, and the cycle leaves GATE:HYPOTHESIS only on a PASS |
| GATE:HYPOTHESIS (a PASS judged unreachable) → advisor / user | the orchestrator judges no re-run will reach a PASS and records that judgment, asking the advisor where it is not confident of it: reachable → a re-run on the answer; not reachable → the operator is asked to confirm closing the issue, the recorded judgment as the direction (`active:false`, `phase:"awaiting-user"`) — the cycle does not close it |

## Unit spawn

- **The spawn.** One `autoflow-unit-analysis` (`Agent`, anonymous, no `name`, the model
  `bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/spawn-policy/spawn-policy.sh model unit-analysis` names) at DIAGNOSE entry. The
  prompt states the goal, the cycle's `mode` and
  the report's path, and names the inputs by path: the issue (new-issue) or the review comment /
  thread PREFLIGHT identified (review-response), and the decision ledger
  (`<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-ledger.md`). In a new-issue cycle it also names the criterion review record
  the ledger's last `[criterion-ready]` entry points at (*Criterion review record* below). In a review-response cycle it also names every artifact the
  previous cycle left (`<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-c{C}-*.md`) and, where REVIEW's triage wrote one, the
  PR's findings file; how much of the previous analysis the unit reuses is its own, recorded under
  `## Method`. On a re-entry it names what the re-entry is for and the material that carries it
  (*Re-entry* below).
- **Documents.** The unit's agent definition carries the documents the analysis needs (this file, and the
  rubric it is scored on, [`evaluation-system.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md) > *Gate rubrics* >
  GATE:HYPOTHESIS) with the rest of its guidance ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Context Injection);
  the prompt copies none of them, and the unit reads anything further by its own judgment.
- **Before the gate (orchestrator-side).** The orchestrator confirms the report exists, is
  non-empty and carries every section *Analysis report* lists. A missing one is an infrastructure
  cause: the unit is spawned again with the same inputs, consuming no counter. The return is then
  routed (*Report routing* below).

## What the analysis owes

The analysis is asked for four things, each conclusion with its grounds:

- the affected structure as it currently is, stated as fact;
- the gap between that structure and the behavior the request asks for — and, where the request
  reports a defect, the cause the gap comes from;
- whether a change is owed and, if so, whether a code change is the lever that closes the gap, or
  data, configuration or operations are;
- the decision points — the judgments the working AI is not the one to make.

How far the analysis pursues a cause, and by what means — how many explanations it weighs, which
ones, what it checks and with which tool — is the unit's judgment, recorded with its grounds under
`## Method` and `## Cause`.

The request is the trigger target — the issue, a review comment or thread, or the finding a
re-entry is for — and the as-is is the state it is measured against, which the unit judges from
what it was spawned for and records under `## Method`. The question is whether the as-is already
satisfies the request.

**Cautions.** Each names a bias the analysis is to avoid:

- Describe the current structure as fact, apart from the issue's defect hypothesis — do not read the
  structure to fit the hypothesis.
- A conclusion that a code change is required rests on evidence that the gap is not closed by
  data, configuration, the environment or an earlier fix; a cause that was not established is not
  presented as one.
- The necessity judgment is reuse-neutral: a resolution that uses existing code is not marked down
  for it. Structural fit and over-engineering are GATE:PLAN's and GATE:QUALITY's.
- Open every material the issue body or an acceptance criterion references — a design mockup, an
  asset, an external document — yourself; one that cannot be opened is recorded with the reason.

How the unit guards against these biases — whether it separates the structure reading from the
issue reading, in what order it reads, what it gives or withholds from a helper — is its own,
recorded with its grounds under `## Method`.

The rules below are the ones other documents cite; everything else about the work is the unit's.

- **Acceptance criteria.** The report's `## Acceptance criteria` table is the issue's single
  machine-addressable acceptance-criterion list; an absent or unparseable table is itself a finding
  downstream ([U3 Design](<autoflow-root>/docs/units/design.md) > *Report routing*;
  [`evaluation-system.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md) > GATE:PLAN > *AC-authority check*). **[MUST]** It is authored once per issue, in the `mode = new-issue` cycle;
  a review-response cycle carries the previous cycle's table forward unchanged — a review comment
  never edits the list; only an `[ac-decision]` ledger entry does
  ([`decision-ledger.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md) > *Acceptance-criterion decisions*; `<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md` > Decision Ledger).
- **Criterion review record** (`mode = new-issue`). The issue's criteria were reviewed against the
  code and policy in the attempt's criterion review stage, and the review's settled decisions were
  recorded in a `[criterion-ready]` entry before PREFLIGHT wrote the state file
  ([`criterion-review.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/criterion-review.md)); the record that review left is an input,
  not a verdict. The analysis reads its findings as an earlier reading of the code and policy at the
  commits its `## Inputs` names: a finding the analysis builds on — a confirmed cause, a policy it
  cites — is checked at the cycle's base, and a difference from the record is recorded with its
  grounds. The record changes nothing about how the criteria are taken: the `## Acceptance criteria`
  table restates the issue's criteria as the body that entry records states them, the analysis does not run
  the review again (issue #291: DIAGNOSE takes the criteria as written), and a defect it observes as
  a fact is still raised as a decision point on the in-cycle path
  ([`decision-ledger.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md) > Decision-point entries > *A criterion can be
  wrong*). The record's findings are the reconciled ones: `## Screening` lists each case a
  criterion applies to with the code that decides it, and `## Cause reach and rule conflict` where
  a confirmed cause reaches beyond the reported points or a required behavior meets a rule in force,
  each read like the findings as an earlier reading; `## Reconciliation` records, per stage 2
  finding and per in-depth case, whether it was applied, rejected or left unresolved. The record's `## Unchecked` items, and each case left `unresolved`,
  are findings the analysis may close with its own checks (*Checking a finding* below). How the
  record was used is recorded under `## Method`.
- **Referenced materials.** Each material is recorded under `## Referenced materials` — what it is,
  where it is, how it was opened, and what it shows for the criterion that names it; the material,
  not an abbreviated example in the body, is what the criterion means. **[MUST]** A material
  recorded `not opened: <reason>` is raised to the operator before the cycle leaves DIAGNOSE
  (`<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md` > Flow Control > *tool or referenced material → user*;
  [`submodule-common-rules.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md) > Verification and Tools > *The tools
  the work needs*).
- **Checking a finding.** A finding the analysis checks is checked with what the environment and the
  target's documents and scripts provide — API calls, queries, service status, logs — and those tools
  are looked for before a finding is left unchecked; a tool that is off is started by the target's
  own procedure, and one that needs the operator is requested (*The tools the work needs*). The
  report records each tool a conclusion rests on and whether it was usable; a finding left unchecked
  names the tool it needed.
- **Scope judgments.** Beyond the acceptance criteria, the analysis names the problems the confirmed
  cause carries — its other sites, and what fixing it will expose — with the scope judgment for each
  and its grounds ([`submodule-common-rules.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md) > Change Surface
  Rules > *Scope judgment*). ARCHITECT reads them and settles the cycle's scope in the feature
  design's `## Scope` section; the analysis does not decide it alone.
- **Decision points.** A judgment the working AI is not the one to make is recorded under
  `## Decision points` with its grounds, and the orchestrator routes it (*Report routing*): a
  planning, design or ADR prerequisite clearly required before the issue can be implemented
  (`mode = new-issue`; when in doubt, none); a request the as-is already satisfies; a gap or a cause
  whose lever is not code; on a reviewer finding, one that repeats the previous
  attempt's complaint with a different witness case ([U7 Review](<autoflow-root>/docs/units/review.md) > *A repeated
  complaint*). A suggested split of the issue stays a suggestion: it is filed only on
  the operator's request, through a draft and `<autoflow-root>/scripts/issue/create-issue.sh`
  ([`issue-proposal.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/issue-proposal.md)).

## Analysis report

`<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-analysis.md`. The unit writes it whole on its first run and brings it up to
date on a re-entry. Every section below is present; a section with nothing to record says `none`.

| Section | Holds | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `## Method` | how the analysis was done — the reading order, any helper spawn and what it was given — and how each caution was kept, with grounds | GATE:HYPOTHESIS |
| `## Current structure` | the affected area as it stands — its structure, design intent and data flow — stated as fact | GATE:HYPOTHESIS |
| `## Request` | the concrete cases the request names, the problem type they share, and the resolution approaches it calls for | GATE:HYPOTHESIS |
| `## Acceptance criteria` | a table with the fixed columns `AC id \| criterion \| source`: `AC id` a short readable name unique within the issue, `criterion` the issue's criterion restated faithfully, `source` its place in the issue body | ARCHITECT, GATE:PLAN, BUILD, GATE:QUALITY |
| `## Referenced materials` | each material the issue or a criterion references, as *What the analysis owes* says, or `none` | ARCHITECT (*Tools*) |
| `## Necessity` | whether the issue is a bug / incident; per resolution approach, the behavior gap and whether code is the lever, with grounds; and the conclusion, exactly one of `no change needed` (the as-is already satisfies the request, or nothing is left to do), `non-code lever` (a real gap whose lever is data / configuration / operations) or `code change` | GATE:HYPOTHESIS; the orchestrator (*Verification — GATE:HYPOTHESIS*) |
| `## Cause` | where the request reports a defect, the cause the analysis established and the evidence for it, how far the cause was pursued and why — or, where it is not established, what is known and what was left unchecked; otherwise `none` with the reason | GATE:HYPOTHESIS |
| `## Scope judgments` | each scope judgment, as *What the analysis owes* says | ARCHITECT; GATE:QUALITY `Minimal implementation`, `Impact scope` |
| `## Affected documents` | the documents the change is expected to update | ARCHITECT; BUILD (spawn prompt) |
| `## Decision points` | each decision point with its grounds, or `none` | the orchestrator (*Report routing*) |

Anything else the unit records is its own, written where it judges useful.

## Report routing

- **A prerequisite** (`mode = new-issue`) → the orchestrator decides it on the report's grounds,
  recorded in an `O` ledger entry; where those grounds do not settle it, or it is not confident, the
  advisor ([`role-contracts.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md) > Advisor), the report as the request's
  anchor, written situation-first ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Execution Principles >
  *Human-decision presentation*).
  **Proceed** → GATE:HYPOTHESIS, after a unit re-run naming the decision's entry where the analysis
  stopped at the prerequisite; **the prerequisite comes first** → the cycle ends with `active:
  false`, `phase: "awaiting-user"`, the report and the decision's record as its report. No counter.
- **A repeated complaint** (a reviewer finding) → the orchestrator decides the re-entry — its
  depth, or none — the advisor where the grounds do not settle it ([U7 Review](<autoflow-root>/docs/units/review.md) > *A
  repeated complaint*). A redefined criterion comes
  back as `[ac-decision]` entries and a unit re-run on them. No counter.
- **Otherwise** → GATE:HYPOTHESIS: one fresh Evaluation AI scores the report. The dispositions — a
  request needing no change, a non-code lever, a FAIL, a PASS judged unreachable — are
  *Verification — GATE:HYPOTHESIS*'s (below); a decision point the report records is confirmed by the
  gate's PASS before any close or end.
- **A material not opened, or a tool the analysis needs that neither this environment nor the
  target's procedures provide, or what using a tool the environment has lacks** — a harness-level block → the operator, situation-first
  (`awaiting-user`; `<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md` > Flow Control > *tool or referenced material → user*).

## Verification — GATE:HYPOTHESIS

One independent Evaluation AI (`autoflow-evaluator`), fresh-spawned per entry on the model
`bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/spawn-policy/spawn-policy.sh model gate-hypothesis` names, scores the report on the
rubric of [`evaluation-system.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md) > *Gate rubrics* > GATE:HYPOTHESIS — one
form for every issue. Its agent definition carries that document. The orchestrator records the
scores under `phases.gate_hypothesis`, with the `verdict` `pending` → `evaluated` for a bug /
incident issue and `skipped (non-bug issue)` otherwise ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > AutoFlow
State Tracking > `verdict` rule). The hook gates the ARCHITECT spawn on the recorded PASS for a bug
/ incident issue only; for any other issue the orchestrator judges the PASS line itself: each ≥ 7,
avg ≥ 7.5.

**PASS** → recommendation triage ([U5 Completion evaluation](<autoflow-root>/docs/units/completion-evaluation.md) >
*Recommendation triage*) → the route the report's `## Necessity` conclusion names:

- **`no change needed`** → no change is made. How the cycle answers the conclusion — closing an
  issue that was already resolved, replying on an open PR, rebutting a reviewer finding a re-entry
  examined ([U7 Review](<autoflow-root>/docs/units/review.md) > *Whether a finding holds*) — is the orchestrator's judgment
  over the situation, recorded with its grounds in the ledger ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Rule
  Scope, principles 2–3). Before it closes an issue, the orchestrator confirms the recorded
  `phases.gate_hypothesis` scores meet the PASS line and the report's conclusion is `no change
  needed`; the close comment records those scores and a summary of the existing mechanism.
- **`non-code lever`** → the orchestrator decides it on the report's grounds, the advisor where they do not settle it or it is not confident
  ([`role-contracts.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/role-contracts.md) > Advisor). **A code change is still owed** → ARCHITECT; **the lever is non-code** → report the
  finding situation-first ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Execution Principles > Human-decision
  presentation) — where a PR is open, as the PR reply — and end the cycle with
  `active: false`, `phase: "awaiting-user"`.
- **`code change`** → ARCHITECT.

**FAIL** → what follows is the orchestrator's judgment over the evaluator's findings, recorded with
its grounds in the ledger — a U2 unit re-run naming the findings and the previous report (*Re-entry*
below) is the usual route. No count caps it: the cycle leaves GATE:HYPOTHESIS only on a PASS.

**A PASS judged unreachable** → when the orchestrator judges that no re-run will bring the report
to a PASS — the re-runs do not converge, or the request cannot be brought to a supported conclusion
— it records that judgment with its grounds in the ledger, and asks the advisor where it is not
confident of it. **Reachable** → a re-run on the answer. **Not reachable** → the issue is not
closed by the cycle: the operator is asked to confirm closing it, situation-first, with the recorded
judgment as the direction (`active: false`, `phase: "awaiting-user"`). This differs from `no
change needed`, whose close the orchestrator makes without the operator's confirmation.

## Re-entry

No unit agent's lifetime spans a spawn: every re-entry spawns a fresh `autoflow-unit-analysis` by
*Unit spawn* above, whose prompt names what the re-entry is for, the material that carries it, and
the report so far. The report is brought up to date, not rewritten; its `## Acceptance criteria`
table changes only by an `[ac-decision]` entry, which the orchestrator applies.

| Re-entry | Material named | Counter |
|---|---|---|
| GATE:HYPOTHESIS FAIL | the evaluation report and its failed items | none — the orchestrator's judgment (*Verification — GATE:HYPOTHESIS* above) |
| a recommendation attempt at GATE:HYPOTHESIS routed to the analysis | the recommendation's subject and finding | the attempt window (max 7×) |
| an advisor answer or operator override that reaches the analysis | the `A` / `O` entries | none |

A re-entry passes through GATE:HYPOTHESIS again on its re-score
([`evaluation-system.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md) > GATE:HYPOTHESIS > *Re-entry re-score*). The unit reads and writes no
`<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}.json` state file, so the counter above is the orchestrator's own accounting.

## Spot-check & escalation discipline (incomplete-output guard)

A DIAGNOSE spot-check is an orchestrator read that confirms a finding of the
analysis report before it feeds a routing decision, a blocker, or a user escalation. A Claude
Code behavior produces a **false "absent / stub" reading**:

- **Read-dedup stub.** A re-read of an unchanged file returns a 1-line stub ("file
  unchanged … refer to that earlier tool_result"), and the dedup ledger is not reset on a
  rewind (or a compaction). The `Read` PostToolUse hook (`<autoflow-root>/hooks/check-read-dedup.sh`) flags this
  at runtime — these rules are the procedure it points to.

- **[MUST]** A blocker / "absent" / "dependency missing" finding is
  **reproduced with a fresh read before it feeds a routing decision or a
  user escalation**. A single read is never sufficient grounds.
- **[MUST]** A blocker/escalation-feeding spot-check reads via **shell**
  (`sed -n 'N,Mp' <file>`, `grep -n`, `wc -l`), not the Read tool.
- **[DENY]** Concluding "absent / empty / stub / smaller-than-expected" from a
  1-line result (`Wasted call` / `file unchanged`). It is a harness stub, not
  data — re-run the single command sequentially first.
- **[MUST]** Spot-checks run **after the unit has returned**, as single
  sequential commands. Another
  directory is addressed with `git -C <path>` + absolute paths rather than a
  `cd`-prefixed compound, which can raise a permission prompt.

## Functional-unit agents (U2 / U3 / U4)

ADR-0025 D1 replaces the sixteen phases with six functional units as the unit of prescription; D2
prescribes a unit by its goal, its artifact contract, its verification and its loop cap only. The
three unit agents that run a unit's work are defined here; U1, U5, U6 and U7 have none (U1, U6 and U7 are the orchestrator's
own work, with scripts that read and report, D8; U5 is the gate itself).

| Unit agent (`subagent_type`) | Unit | Gate class (hook) | Exit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `autoflow-unit-analysis` | U2 Analysis (DIAGNOSE, GATE:HYPOTHESIS) | analysis — no score gate | `gate_hypothesis` |
| `autoflow-unit-design` | U3 Design (ARCHITECT, GATE:PLAN) | planning — GATE:HYPOTHESIS pass, or a `skipped` verdict | `gate_plan` |
| `autoflow-unit-build` | U4 Build and verify (BUILD, AUDIT) | implementation — GATE:PLAN pass | `audit`, test-first judged by its evaluator |

- **Method is the unit's.** How the unit reaches its goal — what else it reads, whether it spawns helpers
  or holds a dialogue, how it designs the issue's own verification — is the unit agent's, recorded
  with its grounds in the unit's artifact ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Rule Scope, principle 2).
  The definitions (`<autoflow-root>/agents/autoflow-unit-*.md`) name the goal, the artifact contract and the
  verification, and nothing else of their own; below that they carry the unit's guidance, generated
  ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Context Injection).
- **A unit agent's spawns inherit its gate class.** The hook admits a spawn whose caller
  (`agent_type`) is a unit agent without a role declaration and judges it by the unit's class; a
  declared role that has a gate of its own keeps that gate too, so an existing role type is never
  judged more loosely because a unit spawned it (`<autoflow-root>/docs/gate-matching-standard.md`
  > P3). The caller is the immediate one: a helper's own spawn is judged by its own declaration.
- **The authority rules hold** (ADR-0025 D3): a unit agent never scores its own artifact, never writes
  the state file or the ledger, never pushes, merges or files an issue, and a decision point it meets
  goes to the advisor.
- **Model and effort** come from the policy rows `unit-analysis`, `unit-design` and `unit-build`,
  held at the values of the phase rows each unit replaces (DIAGNOSE; ARCHITECT; RED /
  GREEN), so each migration step's measurement against the baseline isolates the method change.
  The helpers a U4 unit spawns when it divides its work take theirs from the rows
  `unit-build-area`, `unit-build-verify` and `unit-build-observe`: each is spawned as
  `general-purpose` with the row's model and with the row's effort passed as the `Agent` tool's
  `effort` parameter, omitted when the row reads out the inherit sentinel
  ([U4 Build and verify](<autoflow-root>/docs/units/build.md) > *Dividing the work*). A helper receives in its prompt
  the AutoFlow root and the text of the rules its work follows
  ([U4 Build and verify](<autoflow-root>/docs/units/build.md) > *What crosses a boundary*).

<!-- From <autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md > Reporting Format -->

## Reporting Format

When a role spawn reports to the orchestrator — the report is the spawn's return value, with any body written to `<attempt-dir>/*` and an anchor plus a one-line summary returned — it must follow this shape (see [`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Cost Control > *Orchestrator context discipline*). This format governs **AI↔AI / AI↔orchestrator** reporting: the returned report, and what a unit agent's helpers report to it. It does **not** govern a **human-facing decision pause** — that follows the situation-first contract in [`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Execution Principles > Human-decision presentation (situation → decision/options → anchors-as-evidence).

1. **Reference paths, not bodies**: cite `<attempt-dir>/*` files, source files, and commit hashes by path/hash. Do NOT paste full file bodies or document sections into messages.
2. **One-line summaries**: each finding, fix, or status item gets one line. Tables of ≤ 10 rows are allowed for structured results (test counts, coverage percentages).
3. **Test output**: report the test runner's summary line (e.g., "Tests: 147 passed, 147 total"), read from the run's log (item 5), + coverage percentage. Never paste per-case PASS/FAIL lines or the full coverage report.
4. **Cited code excerpts**: when quoting code is unavoidable (e.g., to point out a bug), keep excerpts ≤ 10 lines AND verify the excerpt against the live file at quoting time.
5. **Evidence anchor (mandatory)**: every "done" / "PASS" / "fixed" claim must end with one verifiable anchor — pick whichever fits:
   - code change → full 40-char commit SHA
   - test pass  → the run's **log** — the file its output was written to (Testing Standards item 7), cited by path under `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-local/` — with the command that produced it and the exact `Tests: N passed, N total` (or equivalent) summary line read from that log. The log is the evidence and the summary line is the value read from it; a line no log carries is not evidence (Verification and Tools > *A run's evidence is the log it left*)
   - file state → `path:line` at the commit SHA the report is keyed to, plus the verbatim content of that line (a line number is read only at that commit — [`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Decision Ledger)
   - observation (a criterion verified with a tool) → the row's observation record, cited by path under `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-local/`, with its result line (`observation: match` / `observation: mismatch — …`) read from it; the artifacts it cites are under the same prefix (Verification and Tools > *The tools the work needs*)
   - lint outcome (the pre-commit lint chain over the staged surface, Change Surface Rules > *Lint chain on the staged surface*) → one line per chain the committing role identified, followed by the grounds of the identification — where it looked (the documents, scripts and CI files read) and each CI lint step it did not count as a chain with the condition that excludes it — the enumeration as a whole standing as this item's one anchor. Each line's form follows its outcome word: `clean` / `fixed-and-staged` / `detected` → the command as invoked, its source (document section, script definition or workflow `path:line` and step name) and the result line it produced; `not-run` → the literal `not-run` plus its reason class in parentheses (`ci-deferred` / `unexecuted`, Change Surface Rules > *`not-run` reason classes*), the reason, and the unexecuted chain's identity (its command and source, or the workflow `path:line` and step name), and a `ci-deferred` line additionally names the covering pull-request job (workflow `path:line` plus job/step name) and the trigger evidence that it runs for this pull request — the workflow's `on: pull_request` entry, either no `paths:` filter or one whose patterns match a staged file, and a job and step condition that admits this pull request; a line missing that evidence is `unexecuted`, not `ci-deferred`; `not-covered` → the chain and the file set it covers; `not-applicable` → that word alone, with the grounds naming where the committing role looked. A report citing one chain where the committing role identified several is malformed, not compliant.

   Anchors must be deterministically confirmable by the orchestrator against what produced them (`git show <SHA>` / the summary line read in the cited log / `git show <SHA>:<file>`); a test-pass anchor is confirmed by reading, not by re-running — the command is re-run only when the log is absent or does not carry the line, and the run is then `not-run` and run in place. Reports without an anchor are rejected, not interpreted. This item's line-number forms are for the report; a long-lived document (an ADR, a design or rule document, an issue body) cites a provision by document, section heading and quoted sentence instead.

<!-- From <autoflow-root>/docs/submodule-common-rules.md > Verification and Tools -->

## Verification and Tools

This section applies to every actor of a cycle — the orchestrator and every role.

**Local verification** (the instance of [`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Rule Scope, principle 2 the phases cite). A change runs, locally and once, the tests the working AI judges it requires — at minimum every `automated` row this cycle authored or changed and every `delivery-check` row — and records each run's command, the log its output was written to, and the summary line read from that log (Reporting Format item 5). Judging which tests a change requires includes finding how the target's CI selects tests for a change — a changed-since selection, a path filter, a suite that only mounts or imports the changed module — in the target's CI configuration; what CI would select is guidance for that judgment, which stays the working AI's. Regression verification is HANDOFF's CI — whatever the target's CI runs. There is no local whole-tree run: none scheduled, none held in reserve.

**A run's evidence is the log it left; a report is confirmed by reading it, not by running it again**. The evidence of a test run is the log file its output was written to (Testing Standards item 7's `$LOG`), cited by path under `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-local/`; the summary line is the value read from that log, and the command is what produced it. What a run left is trusted, and a "done" / "PASS" claim is confirmed by reading the evidence the claim cites: the summary line at the cited log path, the commit at the SHA, the file at the commit. Confirming is not re-executing. Every point that confirms a run record — the orchestrator's acceptance of a role-spawn report ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Execution Principles > *Verify role-spawn claims*), AUDIT's test-first judgment, GATE:QUALITY's `Test coverage` and `Test quality`, the Evaluation AI's anchor resolution — reads the log. A command is re-run only where the evidence is absent or contradicts the record: a record with no log behind it, or a log that does not carry the recorded line, leaves the row `not-run`, and the row is run there and its record filled in (the paragraph below), not failed; at GATE:QUALITY a recorded line the log does not carry is additionally evidence authored without a run and caps the citing item. One ground stays the reproduction itself: re-opening a settled ledger decision on a verified error ([`decision-ledger.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/decision-ledger.md) > Entries > the verified-error exception).

**How a test is run is the target's practice**. AutoFlow prescribes no test command to a target. The role that runs a test — the BUILD unit, or a helper it spawns — finds, in the target checkout it works in, how that target runs its tests: its documents (`CLAUDE.md`, a README, a contributing guide), its scripts (a package manifest's scripts, a Makefile, a wrapper script) and its workspace structure (a monorepo's per-package runner, a submodule's own tree), runs the tests it judges the change requires that way, and records the command, the log and the summary line read from it. What the command executes internally is the target's practice; AutoFlow reads the outcome and adjudicates nothing beyond it. A **cycle-layer asset** — a default `automated` row's test, a `delivery-check`, a `manual` checklist — lives in the attempt's cycle-layer store `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-local/`, under the record root outside the target's tree; it is authored as an executable file there and **invoked directly by its path**, never through a driver AutoFlow ships. The recorded command **names the asset's absolute path in the store** and is run from the target checkout's root: the asset finds the tree it checks from its working directory (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), never from its own location, which is outside every tree. The verification design's table declares the set, and each row's recorded run — its **run record**: command, log path and summary line — is the witness that its asset executed, the log being what the witness is read from. A cycle that wants one command for several assets writes that driver *as* a cycle-layer asset in the same store. Such an asset is never committed, and stays with the attempt's other records. A cycle asset writes its reproducible output — a build result, a copy of a source tree or of another original: an output re-creatable from inputs its record already names, such as a commit and a command — only under the store's reserved path `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-local/disposable/`, which cleanup deletes — the one path it deletes ([`git-workflow.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/git-workflow.md) > Post-Merge Cleanup). Nothing a run record, an observation record or a cycle report cites ever goes there — not a log, a record file, the artifacts an observation left, or the asset itself, whose path the recorded command names — even when it is re-creatable. Whether an output is reproducible and uncited is the writer's judgment; where such an output goes is not. Only the store's top-level `disposable/` is reserved — a `disposable` deeper in the store is kept like any other path — and reproducible output left outside it is a deviation, kept with the rest of the store.

**The tools the work needs are found and used; what a tool lacks is requested from the operator**. Analysis, design, implementation and verification each find the tools they need — a browser to see a screen, a database to see data, a running server to see behavior, any other tool the problem calls for — in this environment (the session's tools, MCP servers included) and in the target (its documents, scripts and workspace structure). AutoFlow names no tool and no method to a target: which tool, what is started and how the result is looked at are the working AI's judgment in that target, recorded with its grounds. The orchestrator pursues securing them. A tool that is off, and whose starting procedure the target's documents or scripts carry (a dev server, a compose file, a seed), is started by that procedure, the procedure cited as the ground; one that must outlive a role spawn is started by the orchestrator ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Execution Principles > *Background execution is orchestrator-only*), and stopped once the cycle no longer needs it. A tool that cannot be used has something missing, and that is what is requested from the operator, situation-first ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Flow Control > *tool or referenced material → user*): the tool itself when this environment does not have it — an installation, enabling an MCP server or a browser extension — or, for a tool it has, what using it lacks — access, the purpose and permitted scope of the host or service it reaches, a credential, a permission setting. Providing any of these is outside the assigned scope ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Cross-Project Boundary Rules); using a tool the environment already provides is not. A purpose or permitted scope is a project fact, asked with the request that the operator record it in the project's information ([`core.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/core.md) > Project Information). The request names what is missing, not the output the tool would give: the output answers one cycle, and the next cycle that needs the same fact stops at the same point. A criterion falls back to a person's observation or a mock only when no tool can be secured: what is missing — the tool, or what using it lacks — was requested and the operator answers that it cannot be provided, or no tool exists that verifies the criterion (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/design.md` > *Tools*). A material an acceptance criterion or the issue body points to — a design mockup, an asset, an external document — is opened, and the record of opening it is an input to analysis and to the verification design; an abbreviated example in the issue body does not stand in for it, and a material that cannot be opened reaches the operator the same way. A criterion verified with a tool is looked at with that tool once implemented: what was looked at, how, and the artifacts it left are its **observation record** under `<attempt-dir>/issue-{N}-local/` — for a screen, the rendered result compared against the referenced material — and, like a run's log, the record is what is read to confirm it, never a second observation. Where each phase does this: `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/analysis.md` (DIAGNOSE), `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/design.md` > *Tools* and `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/build.md` > What the build owes.

**A missing run is filled where it is found, not gated.** A row with no run record — or whose record has no log behind it, or a log that does not carry the recorded line — is `not-run`, never `passed`. Nothing blocks on the omission: it surfaces at the next point that reads the record — a spawn prompt that hands the record to the next role, GATE:QUALITY's `Test coverage` or `Commit conventions` — and is run there, by the role at that point, and its record filled in. An omission is not a FAIL and routes nowhere; a run that fails routes as the phase's own rules say.

**What a cycle leaves in the target's tree is not classified by AutoFlow**. A cycle adds no test file to the target repository by default: a verified criterion's evidence is its one-shot run's record. A test file the cycle does add is the exception, listed in the PR body with the reason it is kept and the CI job that executed it ([`units/delivery.md`](<autoflow-root>/docs/units/delivery.md) > *CI* > *Added test files*), so the reviewer and the operator judge it against the target's own convention — AutoFlow does not certify retention by a token of its own. Which deployment-level checks a target keeps is the target's convention.

AutoFlow's own suite plane — the header contract, the selector and the runner — applies only where the target opted in (`.claude/autoflow.local.json` > `tests.suite_plane: true`).
