# Sub-Repository Common Rules

> Shared rules for every target scope a role works in — the target repository, or a sub-repo of a
> project that has them.

---

## Applicability

These rules apply to every target scope (e.g., backend, frontend, infra, docs) that AutoFlow's modules work in.

---

## Project information

A target's own documents — its `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, contributing guide or whatever it keeps — are read as the project's information ([`core.md`](core.md) > Project Information). AutoFlow prescribes none of them: which files a target or a sub-repo carries, and what they say, is the project's.

---

## AutoFlow Records

AutoFlow's records of an attempt — the decision ledger, the criterion review, the reports and each run's `local/` store — live in the attempt's record directory, under the record root outside every checkout's tree ([`core.md`](core.md) > Records and the hook). Sub-repos do not own AutoFlow records: a role working in a sub-repo writes into the run's output directory its invocation names, and an `.autoflow/` directory found in a sub-repo is residual from a misconfigured run.

---

## Sub-repo pointer

The pull requests a change takes, a sub-repo's included, are the delivery module's
([`units/delivery.md`](units/delivery.md) > *Push and pull request*), and so is the commit of a
sub-repo's pointer on the host branch ([`core.md`](core.md) > Commit Ownership). Whether a sub-repo's
source is a fork or the upstream, and its URL, are the project's information.

---

## Change Surface Rules

Every changed line traces to the change's scope: the applied acceptance criteria, the confirmed cause the analysis recorded, the design, and each problem a recorded scope judgment includes (**Scope judgment** below). What belongs to the change is decided by that judgment, not by whether an acceptance criterion names the line. How small the change stays inside that scope is governed by **Trace rule**, **Surrounding code** and the **Over-engineering guard** below.

### Scope judgment
A role that meets a problem the acceptance criteria do not name answers two questions and records the answers with their grounds in the report or artifact its run already produces ([`core.md`](core.md) > Rule Scope, principle 2).

1. **Is it directly related to this issue?** It is when any one of these holds:
   - it comes from the same confirmed cause;
   - this change created it or exposed it;
   - unless it is fixed, the behavior an acceptance criterion promises does not hold in actual use.
2. **Is fixing it in this change desirable?** It is when it lies in the same module, is confirmed by the same verification, and fixing it separately would reopen the same code. It is not when it needs a design decision of its own, touches another ownership scope, or carries more risk than this issue.

| Judgment | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Directly related, fixing it here desirable | fixed in this change; the recorded judgment is the trace of its hunks |
| Directly related, fixing it here not desirable | separated, with its **separation reason** recorded |
| Not directly related | separated — reported in one line with its `path:line`; a separate issue is the follow-up path |

- **The default follows the first question.** A directly related problem is included unless a separation reason is recorded. A problem noticed in passing — a style inconsistency, pre-existing dead code, a refactor opportunity — meets none of the three conditions and stays out (**Surrounding code**, **Refactor scope**).
- **An inclusion is verified like the rest of the scope.** In the design it is named in the feature design's scope and disposed of in the verification design (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/design.md` > Output artifacts); found later, the role that fixes it runs the tests it judges the fix requires and records the run (Verification and Tools > *Local verification*).
- **Criterion defects.** From the design on, beside the two questions the role weighs whether what it met shows a criterion defective ([`decision-ledger.md`](decision-ledger.md) > *Acceptance-criterion decisions*). A same-cause problem reaching past what the criteria name may mean the issue drew the problem too narrowly — and then whether the approach itself must change is the question, not only whether to include the rest; an item a criterion names that turns out to be a problem separate from this issue may mean it drew too wide. Including a problem does not change a criterion, and a criterion is not carried out merely because it names an item: a defect so judged is recorded here, and the role puts the change — the criterion, the proposed change and the fact that shows it — to the advisor and follows the decision ([`decision-ledger.md`](decision-ledger.md) > *Acceptance-criterion decisions*; [`role-contracts.md`](role-contracts.md) > Advisor).
- A role that doubts a scope judgment, or whose inclusion would change a design decision, puts it to the advisor and follows the decision ([`core.md`](core.md) > Development Lifecycle > *Decisions within a module*).
- **Where it is applied**: the analysis report's scope judgments and the scope the feature design states set the change's scope; the build judges what it meets during the work.

### Trace rule
- Each touched file/line answers the question: "which acceptance criterion, confirmed cause, plan item or recorded scope judgment requires this?" If the answer is "none — I noticed it while I was here", revert that line.

### Surrounding code
- Match the existing style and naming in the file you edit, even if you would write it differently in a greenfield.
- Leave adjacent code, comments, formatting, and import order untouched unless an AC or a recorded scope judgment requires the change. A comment attached to code this change modifies is not adjacent — it is part of the change (**Code comments** > *Changing commented code*).

### Over-engineering guard
The trace rule rejects scope creep *across* the change surface; this guard rejects depth creep *inside* it. Keep the solution to the minimum the change's scope needs:
- **Scope**: don't add features, configurability, or "improvements" beyond the change's scope (**Scope judgment**). A bug fix doesn't clean up surrounding code; a simple feature doesn't gain extra options.
- **Documentation**: don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. What a comment on changed code may carry is **Code comments** below.
- **Defensive coding**: don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't occur. Trust internal code and framework guarantees; validate only at system boundaries (user input, external APIs).
- **Abstractions**: don't create helpers or abstractions for a one-time operation, and don't design for hypothetical future requirements.

### Code comments
The rule governs every comment in code a change writes or modifies — implementation and test files, in a target and in this repository. Existing comments on code the change leaves untouched stay as they are (**Surrounding code**).

- **The test**: a comment carries only a sentence that stays true for as long as the code it sits on is unchanged — however much time passes, and whatever changes in other files.
- **What a comment carries** — only what a reader cannot recover from the code, and only in one of these cases, each about the code the comment sits on:
  - an external constraint: the behavior of a runtime, a tool, or a protocol the code depends on;
  - an invariant that the code does not make evident;
  - what breaks if the code is written otherwise, in a line or two;
  - a function's contract — its arguments, return value, and exit codes — in one line.
- **What a comment does not carry**:
  - a restatement of what the code does;
  - design discussion and rejected alternatives;
  - change history — what the code did before, what it no longer does, what an earlier version wrote;
  - an issue, PR, review-round, or acceptance-criterion identifier;
  - the path or the contract of another file;
  - commented-out code.
- **Where that content goes**: a decision and its grounds → the repository's decision record (in this repository, `docs/records/adr/` and `docs/records/design-rationale.md`); change history → the commit message and the PR body; discussion → the attempt's design documents in its record directory and the issue. The only reference a comment carries is at most one ADR identifier (`ADR-0024`).
- **Test files**: a test's intent is stated in its name and its assertion messages. A comment in a test file carries only the reason for a fixture that the fixture does not make evident.
- **Changing commented code**: a comment attached to code this change modifies is updated or deleted in the same commit. When it is uncertain whether the comment is still true, delete it.
- **Directives are code**: a line a tool reads to change its behavior is code even when written in comment syntax — a lint suppression or a type-checker directive, for example — and this rule does not govern it; an explanation written beside it is a comment and does. Which lines are directives is the working AI's judgment in that target; no list is kept.

The build checks the change's diff against this rule (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/build.md` > What the build owes, *Comment check*). In a target's code, a comment that diverges from its code or carries what this rule sends out of a comment is a `Low` finding for the reviewer and the evaluator; a defect a comment carries on its own ground, such as an exposed credential, takes the severity its impact sets (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/completion-evaluation.md` > *Code comments in a target*).

### Orphans from this change
- **[MUST]** Imports, variables, and functions that **your** changes rendered unused are removed in the same commit.
- **[MUST]** Do not remove pre-existing unused symbols unless an AC or a recorded scope judgment requires it.

### Lint chain on the staged surface
- **[MUST]** Before a commit is made, the committing role runs every lint chain of the target repository that covers at least one staged file over the staged files, and confirms zero errors attributable to them. Auto-fixable formatting is applied and staged in the same commit.

**Which chains exist, and how each runs, is the target's practice.** AutoFlow prescribes no lint command and no discovery order to a target. The committing role finds, at the location it commits in, how that target lints a change; the judgment and its grounds go into the report (**Evidence anchor** below).

**Execution trust boundary** — **[MUST]** the command run at commit time is one the baseline — the base the branch is to merge into, at its merge-base with `HEAD` (`git merge-base HEAD origin/<base>`; the remote's default branch unless the invocation names another, `params.base`) — already carries. Before running it, the committing role confirms that the command's text at its source — the document entry, the script definition or the CI step body it was taken from — and any script file that text invokes by path are unchanged versus the baseline. A command this branch altered or added is not executed, whichever source it came from, and the report says so. A command is run exactly as its source states it — a read-only check, not licence to run any other step, argument or command its source names.

**A chain that cannot run** in the working checkout, or that the trust boundary withholds, is reported with the reason. It imposes a reporting obligation, not a blocking one: the commit proceeds. Making a chain locally executable belongs to the target repository's ops and is outside this rule's authority; a tool the work needs is used, or requested, as Verification and Tools > *The tools the work needs* says.

**Scoping** — run the chain restricted to the staged files where the chain supports scoping. Where the chain only runs whole-tree, run it whole-tree and require that no reported error names a staged file; pre-existing errors on untouched files are not this change's surface (**Surrounding code**).

**What the report holds** — for each chain the committing role identified: whether it ran and what it reported, or why it did not run; or that the target has no lint chain. Findings attributable to the staged files that were not auto-fixed hold the commit until they are resolved. A chain that could not run names the pull-request CI job that runs the same chain over the staged files for this pull request, where one does. Such a deferral is discharged by the ci module's green verdict on the pull request ([`units/delivery.md`](units/delivery.md) > *CI*); that verdict is over the rollup, not a per-job guarantee, so the citation of the job and the evidence that it runs for this pull request are what tie the deferral to it, and the evaluators re-derive them from the report. Where CI did not run, the deferral is not discharged and the chain is listed on the pull request as not run.

- **[MUST]** A chain that did not execute is never reported as having passed.

**Evidence anchor** — the committing role's report carries the lint outcome (Reporting Format > *Evidence anchor*): each chain it identified, followed by the grounds of the identification.

### Refactor scope
A refactor of the change's diff applies the same trace rule: refactor suggestions that touch code outside the change surface are rejected, recorded in the report, and (if worth pursuing) filed as a new issue. A refactor tool's findings are advisory, not licence to expand the change surface. A finding that describes a behavior defect rather than a refactor is not a refactor to apply: the build records its **Scope judgment**.

### GATE:QUALITY linkage
GATE:QUALITY's `Minimal implementation` and `Impact scope` items are scored against this section, on one scope: prefer the smallest sufficient change that resolves the confirmed problem within the change's scope. The change's scope is the applied acceptance criteria, the confirmed cause the analysis report records, and the problems its recorded scope judgments include (**Scope judgment**) — a boundary, not a line count. A correctly scoped change is not scored down for being larger than a symptom patch. The evaluator reads the scope records for both items: the feature design's `## Scope` section, every scope judgment in the reports the evaluation is given, and the recommendations deferred or separated after earlier evaluations (`deferred`).

A high-scoring change:
- resolves the confirmed cause, not only the reported symptom
- stays inside the module or component that owns that cause
- includes the local cleanup the fix itself requires — the code and symbols this change renders unreachable or unused, removed in the same commit; cleanup merely noticed nearby does not qualify (**Surrounding code**), and **Orphans from this change** is the symbol-removal instance of this same test, not its limit
- fixes each directly related problem its scope judgments include, and leaves out a directly related problem only with a recorded separation reason
- leaves every surface outside the scope untouched — behavior, APIs, configuration, and documentation are examples of such a surface, not the boundary — and keeps, inside it, the existing behavior that neither the acceptance criteria, the confirmed cause nor a problem its scope judgments include asks to change, a protection or the order of checks included; recording such a change as a known gap does not bring it into scope

`Minimal implementation` asks whether each hunk is needed. The question is asked against the smallest change that satisfies the acceptance criteria, with the tests its verification design requires, and resolves the confirmed cause: a hunk beyond it stands only on its own recorded ground. It fails when a hunk traces to no acceptance criterion, confirmed cause or recorded scope judgment — "I noticed it while I was here" cleanup (**Surrounding code**) or depth creep beyond what the scope needs (**Over-engineering guard**) — regardless of code quality, and when a hunk rests on a scope judgment that meets none of question 1's three conditions. It fails symmetrically when the change is too narrow to resolve the confirmed cause: a change that leaves the confirmed cause in place is not sufficient, and does not score well for being small.

`Impact scope` asks the same question from the other side: whether the change reaches what its scope requires. A directly related problem that the attempt's own records show — a scope judgment, a build observation, an earlier evaluation's recommendation — and that the change leaves out with no separation reason recorded lowers it, as does a separation reason that answers neither half of question 2.

**Comments in a target's code.** The item also weighs the comments the change adds, by content and by volume, reading the build report's comment check (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/build.md` > Build report) with the comments in the diff:
- *Content*: a comment that **Code comments** does not admit — a restatement of the code, a design ground, a reference or a history — is depth the AC does not need, as an unneeded hunk is.
- *Volume*: even where every comment is admitted, the evaluator judges whether their amount, absolute and relative to the code they sit on, exceeds what a reader of the changed code needs — a comment block larger than the logic it explains, for example. The judgment is qualitative, with no ratio threshold, and names the comment blocks it rests on.

The evaluator records each such finding in the item's `reason` and in `recommendations`, and does not lower the item's score for it: in a target a comment finding never fails the gate (`<autoflow-root>/docs/evaluation-system.md` > *Code comments in a target*, which also names the defects a comment can carry on their own ground and that this exclusion does not cover). In this repository the item is scored without this comment weighing.

## Reporting Format

When a role spawn reports to the session that spawned it, the report is the spawn's return value:

1. **The body goes to the run's output directory.** The report points at it — record files, source files and commits by path and hash — and does not carry it.
2. **Evidence anchor**: a claim that something is done, passes or is fixed carries what its reader needs to confirm it by reading. Forms that serve, for reference:
   - code change → commit SHA
   - test pass → the run's log, cited by path under the run's `<out>/local/`, with the command that produced it and the summary line read from that log (Verification and Tools > *A run's evidence is the log it left*)
   - file state → `path:line` at the commit SHA the report is keyed to, with the content of that line
   - observation (a criterion verified with a tool) → the row's observation record, cited by path under the run's `<out>/local/`, with its result read from it; the artifacts it cites are under the same prefix (Verification and Tools > *The tools the work needs*)
   - lint outcome (the pre-commit lint chain over the staged surface, Change Surface Rules > *Lint chain on the staged surface*) → each chain the committing role identified, followed by the grounds of the identification — where it looked and each CI lint step it did not count as a chain, with the condition that excludes it — the enumeration as a whole standing as this item's one anchor. For a chain that ran: the command, its source and what it reported. For one that did not: which chain and why, and where a pull-request CI job runs it instead, that job and the evidence that it runs for this pull request.

   A line number is read at the commit it names; a long-lived document (an ADR, a design or rule document, an issue body) cites a provision by document, section heading and quoted sentence instead.
3. **Short**: the report holds what its reader needs to act and to confirm, and no more.

---

## Verification and Tools

This section applies to every actor of a module's run — the session that runs it and every role it spawns.

**Local verification** (the instance of [`core.md`](core.md) > Rule Scope, principle 2 the modules cite). A change runs, locally and once, the tests the working AI judges it requires — at minimum every test it authored or changed and every check the verification design runs before delivery — and records each run's command, the log its output was written to, and the summary line read from that log (Reporting Format > *Evidence anchor*). Judging which tests a change requires includes finding how the target's CI selects tests for a change — a changed-since selection, a path filter, a suite that only mounts or imports the changed module — in the target's CI configuration; what CI would select is guidance for that judgment, which stays the working AI's. Regression verification is the pull request's CI — whatever the target's CI runs. There is no local whole-tree run: none scheduled, none held in reserve.

**A run's evidence is the log it left; a report is confirmed by reading it, not by running it again**. The evidence of a test run is the log file its output was written to, cited by path under the run's `<out>/local/`; the summary line is the value read from that log, and the command is what produced it. What a run left is trusted, and a "done" / "PASS" claim is confirmed by reading the evidence the claim cites: the summary line at the cited log path, the commit at the SHA, the file at the commit. Confirming is not re-executing. Every point that confirms a run record — the spawning session's acceptance of a role-spawn report ([`core.md`](core.md) > Execution Principles > *Verify role-spawn claims*), AUDIT's test-first judgment, GATE:QUALITY's `Test coverage` and `Test quality`, the Evaluation AI's anchor resolution — reads the log. A command is re-run only where the evidence is absent or contradicts the record: a record with no log behind it, or a log that does not carry the recorded line, leaves the row `not-run`, and the row is run there and its record filled in (the paragraph below), not failed; at GATE:QUALITY a recorded line the log does not carry is additionally evidence authored without a run and caps the citing item. One ground stays the reproduction itself: re-opening a settled ledger decision on a verified error ([`decision-ledger.md`](decision-ledger.md) > Entries > the verified-error exception).

**How a test is run is the target's practice**. AutoFlow prescribes no test command to a target. The role that runs a test — the build unit, or a helper it spawns — finds, in the target checkout it works in, how that target runs its tests: its documents (`CLAUDE.md`, a README, a contributing guide), its scripts (a package manifest's scripts, a Makefile, a wrapper script) and its workspace structure (a monorepo's per-package runner, a submodule's own tree), runs the tests it judges the change requires that way, and records the command, the log and the summary line read from it. What the command executes internally is the target's practice; AutoFlow reads the outcome and adjudicates nothing beyond it. A **run's own check** — a test the target's tree does not keep, a check run before delivery, a manual checklist — lives in the run's store `<out>/local/`, under the record root outside the target's tree; it is authored as an executable file there and **invoked directly by its path**, never through a driver AutoFlow ships. The recorded command **names the asset's absolute path in the store** and is run from the target checkout's root: the asset finds the tree it checks from its working directory (`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), never from its own location, which is outside every tree. The verification design's table declares the set, and each row's recorded run — its **run record**: command, log path and summary line — is the witness that its asset executed, the log being what the witness is read from. A run that wants one command for several assets writes that driver *as* an asset in the same store. Such an asset is never committed, and stays with the attempt's other records, where a later run reads it. An asset writes its reproducible output — a build result, a copy of a source tree or of another original: an output re-creatable from inputs its record already names, such as a commit and a command — only under the store's reserved path `<out>/local/disposable/`, the one path that can be deleted with nothing the records cite lost; its deletion is outside AutoFlow ([`git-workflow.md`](git-workflow.md) > Post-Merge Cleanup). Nothing a run record, an observation record or a report cites ever goes there — not a log, a record file, the artifacts an observation left, or the asset itself, whose path the recorded command names — even when it is re-creatable. Whether an output is reproducible and uncited is the writer's judgment; where such an output goes is not. Only the store's top-level `disposable/` is reserved — a `disposable` deeper in the store is kept like any other path — and reproducible output left outside it is a deviation, kept with the rest of the store.

**The tools the work needs are found and used; what is missing is requested, and the run still ends**. Analysis, design, implementation and verification each find the tools they need — a browser to see a screen, a database to see data, a running server to see behavior, any other tool the problem calls for — in this environment (the session's tools, MCP servers included) and in the target (its documents, scripts and workspace structure). AutoFlow names no tool and no method to a target: which tool, what is started and how the result is looked at are the working AI's judgment in that target, recorded with its grounds. A tool that is off, and whose starting procedure the target's documents or scripts carry (a dev server, a compose file, a seed), is started by that procedure, the procedure cited as the ground; one that must outlive a role spawn is started by the main session ([`core.md`](core.md) > Execution Principles > *Background execution is the main session's only*), and stopped once the run no longer needs it. A tool that cannot be used has something missing: the tool itself when this environment does not have it — an installation, enabling an MCP server or a browser extension — or, for a tool it has, what using it lacks — access, the purpose and permitted scope of the host or service it reaches, a credential, a permission setting. Providing any of these is outside the assigned scope ([`core.md`](core.md) > Cross-Project Boundary Rules); using a tool the environment already provides is not. What is missing is recorded as a **tool request** — `{missing, instead}` in `<out>/tool-requests.json`: what is missing, named as what is missing and not as the output the tool would give, and what the run did instead, each verification it left unrun or ran on a mock or a person's observation for the lack included. The run does what it can without it — a mock, an observation, a verification left not run, by its own judgment — and ends; the delivery module states every request in the pull request, and the operator decides on it ([`core.md`](core.md) > Development Lifecycle > *Tools*). A purpose or permitted scope is a project fact, and its request asks that the operator record it in the project's information ([`core.md`](core.md) > Project Information). A material an acceptance criterion or the issue body points to — a design mockup, an asset, an external document — is opened, and the record of opening it is an input to analysis and to the verification design; an abbreviated example in the issue body does not stand in for it, and a material that cannot be opened is a tool request the same way. A criterion verified with a tool is looked at with that tool once implemented: what was looked at, how, and the artifacts it left are its **observation record** under the run's `<out>/local/` — for a screen, the rendered result compared against the referenced material — and, like a run's log, the record is what is read to confirm it, never a second observation. Where each module does this: `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/analysis.md`, `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/design.md` > *Tools* and `<autoflow-root>/docs/units/build.md` > What the build owes.

**A missing run is filled where it is found, not gated.** A row with no run record — or whose record has no log behind it, or a log that does not carry the recorded line — is `not-run`, never `passed`. Nothing blocks on the omission: it surfaces at the next point that reads the record — a later module given the record, GATE:QUALITY's `Test coverage` or `Commit conventions` — and is run there, by the role at that point, and its record filled in. An omission is not a FAIL; a run that fails is recorded as its module's procedure says.

**What a change leaves in the target's tree is not classified by AutoFlow**. A change adds no test file to the target repository by default: a verified criterion's evidence is its one-shot run's record. A test file the change does add is the exception, listed in the PR body with the reason it is kept and the CI job that executed it ([`units/delivery.md`](units/delivery.md) > *CI*, *Added test files*), so the reviewer and the operator judge it against the target's own convention — AutoFlow does not certify retention by a token of its own. Which deployment-level checks a target keeps is the target's convention.

AutoFlow's own suite plane — the header contract, the selector and the runner — applies only where the target opted in (`.claude/autoflow.local.json` > `tests.suite_plane: true`).

---

## Testing Standards

### Running the bash suite tree (opted-in targets)

Where the target opted into AutoFlow's suite plane (`.claude/autoflow.local.json` > `tests.suite_plane: true`), bash suites under `tests/**` are run through `<autoflow-root>/scripts/test/run-suites.sh`, not by ad-hoc enumeration. Selection has one owner — `<autoflow-root>/scripts/test/select-suites.sh` — and both CI and the local runner consume it. Which suites a change requires is the working AI's judgment, recorded with its grounds ([`core.md`](core.md) > Rule Scope); the selector is the device that answers it here. Elsewhere the target's tests run the way the target runs them.

- `bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/test/run-suites.sh` — the suites this change requires, selected from each suite's own `# ci-subject:` header against the resolved delta. An unresolvable base, or an enumerated suite with no usable `# ci-subject:` header, is a visible `BLOCK` and a non-zero exit with nothing executed, never a silent empty selection — carry the `BLOCK:` lines into the report (`<autoflow-root>/docs/units/build.md` > Header contract > *Adopting the contract over existing suites*).
- `bash <autoflow-root>/scripts/test/run-suites.sh --list` — the selected set without running it.

The runner de-duplicates by resolved path, so a suite cannot execute twice in one pass; arms a wall-clock bound of `<effective local ceiling>` around each suite — via `timeout`, `gtimeout`, or a detached sleep-and-kill watchdog when neither binary exists on the host — and reports an overrun as a distinct `TIMEOUT`; and prints one result line with elapsed time per suite. Each suite's output is captured while it runs: a `PASS` discards the capture, while a `FAIL` or `TIMEOUT` replays it in full between framing lines directly under that suite's result line.

**The two clocks are not the same clock.** `budget-secs` is a **CI-clock** quantity — derived from the suite's own CI step duration, bounded by `SUITE_BUDGET_CEILING_SECS`, and spent by CI through that step's `timeout-minutes`. A local run spends a **local allowance** derived from it by one tree-wide ratio:

    effective local ceiling = budget-secs × SUITE_LOCAL_SLOWDOWN_FACTOR

Both constants live in `<autoflow-root>/scripts/test/suite-manifest.sh`, and the factor is not environment-settable.

**A local `TIMEOUT` is not a budget signal.** The local gate is a hang detector, not a seconds-level cost gate, so an overrun is a hang or an order-of-magnitude regression. **Investigate the suite — do not bump `budget-secs`**. Cost is governed where the numbers are derived: on the CI clock, by `timeout-minutes`.

A suite executes its subject, not another suite (`<autoflow-root>/scripts/test/check-suite-leaf.sh`). Confirming that a sibling has not regressed is its own CI step's job.

### Bash execution mode

> Canonical: docs/role-common-rules.md > Bash Execution Mode.

- A role spawn runs **every** Bash command in the **foreground** and never uses `run_in_background` — for any command, test/build verification runs included, **and specifically including a command the agent itself chooses to background for its own verification run** (a self-selected `run_in_background:true` on the agent's own test/build, with no such instruction given, is a violation of this clause). This binds every direct `autoflow-*` subagent (analyzer, evaluator, advisor, the unit agents) **and** every helper a unit agent spawns. Run the command, wait for its result, then report.
- The background + completion-notification pattern is **the main session's only**.
- **Enforced at the tool boundary for suite runs:** a backgrounded invocation of `<autoflow-root>/scripts/test/run-suites.sh` — the `run_in_background` payload field, a `nohup`/`setsid` prefix, or a trailing `&` — is **refused** by the PreToolUse hook for every actor, the main session included; the main session's background pattern above never extends to a suite run (`<autoflow-root>/docs/gate-matching-standard.md` > Rule P1 > Backgrounded-invocation refinement).
