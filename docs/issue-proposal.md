# Issue Proposal — Draft Grammar and Filing Procedure

An issue is filed from a **draft on disk**, never from arguments typed at the
moment of filing. `gh issue create` is denied at the tool boundary
(`.claude/hooks/check-autoflow-gate.sh` > Section 1); the only filing path is:

```bash
scripts/issue/create-issue.sh --draft <path> [--repo <owner/name>] [--dry-run]
```

The wrapper derives search terms from the draft's **own title**, runs the query
itself, and then compares what that query returned against the candidates the
draft dispositioned. It never judges whether a disposition is *correct* — that
judgment is the operator's, at layer three. It refuses when the draft disposes of
nothing the wrapper found.

Three layers guard the path:

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | hook deny on `gh issue create` and its REST form |
| 2 | `scripts/issue/create-issue.sh` re-runs the query and compares dispositions |
| 3 | the operator permission prompt on the wrapper |

Layer three works by **omission**: keep the wrapper off every allow list —
neither `"Bash(scripts/issue/create-issue.sh:*)"` nor a broad `Bash(scripts/*)` /
`Bash(scripts/issue/*)` goes into `.claude/settings.json` or
`.claude/settings.local.json`.

## Draft grammar

Write the draft **directly inside** `.autoflow/`, at its top level.

Four required level-2 sections, in **any order** — each runs from its own
heading to the next level-2 heading or to end of file:

```markdown
## Title
[feat] one line, exactly as the issue title should read

## Grounds
`scripts/issue/create-issue.sh` > `has_section "Grounds"` — "a grounding anchor under '## Grounds'": the check runs here, not in the caller

## Duplicate check
searched: create-issue duplicate gate
candidates: none

## Body
The issue body, verbatim. Everything here — and nothing from the other
sections — becomes the created issue's body.
```

| Section | Content | Wrapper's check |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `## Title` | one line — the issue title | non-empty single line |
| `## Grounds` | why the issue is warranted | at least one anchor: a commit SHA, a URL, or a durable citation — a document, its section heading and a quoted sentence, written `` `<path>` > <heading> — "<fragment>" ``. A bare `path:line` is not an anchor here |
| `## Duplicate check` | a `searched:` line listing the query terms, then either `candidates: none` or one `#<number> — <disposition>` row per candidate | the `searched:` line is present and non-empty; its tokens feed the term derivation; the candidate rows are the set the disposition invariant compares against |
| `## Body` | the text from its heading to the next level-2 heading | non-empty; becomes the issue body |

A heading inside the body is written at level 3 or deeper (`### Background`),
never at level 2. A `## ` line ends the section above it wherever it sits — a
fenced code block included — so the text under a level-2 heading that names none
of the four sections belongs to no section. The wrapper refuses such a draft,
naming each such heading with its line, instead of filing the body cut short at
it.

## The two names of the artifact

| Stage | Path | Swept by the cleanup archive matcher? |
|-------|------|---------------------------------------|
| Before creation (draft) | `.autoflow/issue-proposal-<slug>.md` | **no** |
| After creation | `.autoflow/issue-<N>-proposal.md` | **yes**, with issue `<N>`'s cycle |

An unfiled draft outlives any other issue's cleanup, and only its author abandons
it. Once the issue exists the artifact belongs to a cycle, and the wrapper's
rename puts it in the `issue-<N>-*` companion form the matcher sweeps.

## What the wrapper does

1. Refuses unless the draft is a regular file directly inside the repository's
   `.autoflow/`. The directory being **absent** is diagnosed separately from a
   misplaced draft, with a different message. The wrapper does not create the
   directory. A draft that is itself a symlink is refused rather than resolved.
2. Refuses a draft missing any required element, or carrying a level-2 heading
   outside the four sections, naming **every** such defect.
3. Derives title terms by a rule with no implementation freedom: strip a leading
   `[tag]`; lowercase the ASCII range only; split on whitespace and ASCII
   punctuation, with bytes outside ASCII never acting as separators, so a
   non-ASCII run survives as one token; keep a token of `[a-z0-9]` at ≥ 4
   codepoints and a token carrying non-ASCII at ≥ 2; deduplicate keeping first
   appearance; keep the first 8. Codepoints are counted **locale-free**.
4. Appends the `searched:` line's tokens under the same lowercase/separator rule,
   with no floor and no cap. Recorded terms are strictly **additive**: they can
   only lengthen the query.
5. Refuses if the title derives **no** term.
6. Runs **one query per term**, `--state all`, `--limit 100`. If any one term
   returns a full page → refuse, naming the term.
7. Refuses if any returned issue number is not already dispositioned in the
   draft, listing the undispositioned numbers.
8. On success — and only then — renames the draft to
   `.autoflow/issue-<N>-proposal.md`, with `<N>` parsed from the URL `gh`
   returned. A URL with no parsable trailing number is a failed bind: the draft
   stays put.

`--dry-run` runs every check and creates nothing, leaving the draft in place.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | created, or `--dry-run` passed every check |
| `64` | usage, or the draft is not directly inside the derived `.autoflow` (including that directory being absent) |
| `65` | refusal — missing section, a level-2 heading outside the four sections, no grounding anchor, no derivable term, an undispositioned candidate, or a query at its page limit |
| `70` | the issue was created but its number could not be bound |
| other | `gh`'s own exit, propagated |

The floors, the cap, the tag strip and their order are **fixed constants in the
script, not flags**; an unrecognised argument is a usage error.

## Accepted limits

Each limit below is an under-block, with layer three as the catch:

- The term cap drops terms on ordinary titles, so a duplicate reachable only
  through a dropped term is never surfaced, and the wrapper reports a clean
  check.
- A term is queried in the surface form the title wrote, so a duplicate phrased
  with a different inflection of the same word falls outside the candidate set.
- On a large tracker a common derived term can return a full page and trip the
  truncation refusal, leaving the agent unable to file until a human intervenes —
  the escape is the operator's, not the agent's.
- The REST-form deny matches any same-segment `POST` paired with a
  `repos/…/issues` path regardless of client, so the plain `curl -X POST
  https://api.github.com/repos/<o>/<r>/issues` form is denied too. The path is
  required to end at the issues collection, and it is taken to end at exactly
  two suffix delimiters — a query `?` and a fragment `#` — so
  `repos/<o>/<r>/issues?per_page=1` and `repos/<o>/<r>/issues#note` are denied
  as well, while `…/issues/12/comments` stays unmatched. No other delimiter is
  claimed: the trailing-slash form `…/issues/ --method POST` is **not** matched.
  What is not matched beyond that is a determined evasion — an obfuscated URL,
  a client invoked through a wrapper script, a quoted form (the hook's scan
  strips quoted substrings exactly as it does for every other Section 1 deny),
  or a command-substituted form (which the scan does *not* strip — it goes
  unmatched). The threat model is the routine self-authorized filing, not a
  determined evasion.
