# Decision Ledger

The per-issue decision ledger, `.autoflow/{repo-key}-issue-{N}/issue-{N}-ledger.md`: what an entry records, how it is
identified, and the grammar of the entries a decision point produces — the advisor's first judgment
and the operator's override. The ledger's standing constraints —
append-only, no re-litigation without a new verified fact, host ownership, and identifier
allocation — are [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) > Decision Ledger.

## Entries

- Each entry records: the decision (one line), its **grounds** (evidence: a commit SHA with `path:line` for a fact of this tree, a summary line with its command, or — for a provision of a long-lived document — the document, section heading and quoted sentence), its **authority** (what settled it — `advisor decision`, `GATE:PLAN PASS (avg 8.2)`, `operator decision`), and the cycle/phase.
- **The verified-error exception** to the rule that a recorded decision is not re-litigated without a new verified fact ([`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) > Decision Ledger). An entry whose grounds carry an objective contradiction, an arithmetic error or a wrong source may be superseded without a new fact when all three hold: (1) the error is **reproduced by command output** — a command run over the material the entry cites, whose summary line shows the two grounds contradicting each other, the miscalculation, or the cited source absent or saying otherwise; (2) the re-opening is **judged by the decision's original authority** — a gate verdict by a fresh Evaluation AI re-scoring that item, an ARCHITECT design decision — recorded in the feature design, not the ledger — by a U3 Design unit re-run naming its heading there (an ARCHITECT re-entry, consuming that counter, unless the design has not yet reached GATE:PLAN), an advisor decision by a fresh advisor, an operator decision by the operator — and when that authority cannot say with confidence that the error changes the decision, it asks the advisor ([`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) > Rule Scope, principle 3); (3) the correction records the reproducing command and its summary line in the grounds form above and names what it supersedes — for a ledger entry, in the superseding entry's grounds, by the superseded entry's identifier; for a feature-design decision, in the U3 re-run's delta item, as `supersedes <heading>` ([`units/design.md`](units/design.md) > *Re-entry*). A change of preference or a re-interpretation of the same material is not an error and stays barred.

**Writers**. The advisor appends its answer to a decision point under the authority `advisor decision`, and it alone writes that authority (*Advisor decisions and operator overrides* below); the ARCHITECT design unit and the BUILD unit append nothing — their decisions and records are their own artifacts ([`units/design.md`](units/design.md), [`units/build.md`](units/build.md) > Build report); the orchestrator appends each gate's verdict after the gate, each auto-resolution attempt and rebuttal round at a gate or at HANDOFF, an operator override of an advisor decision when the operator gives one, and — before the issue's first cycle — the operator's criterion-readiness confirmation (*Criterion-readiness confirmations* below).

## Entry identifier

A settled-decision entry is headed `## <ID> — <title> (cycle <C>, <PHASE>)`, where `<ID>` is a one-letter **writer namespace** followed by a serial that counts within that namespace only. An auto-triggered review-response entry carries its HANDOFF marker in the same grammar: `## O<n> — <title> (cycle <C>, HANDOFF) [review-autofix]` — the marker stays at the end of the heading. The operator's decision to continue after an attempt-cap pause is an `O` entry under `operator decision` whose heading ends in `[reentry-decision]`; the attempt count restarts after it ([`units/delivery.md`](units/delivery.md) > *Routing* > Attempt cap). An entry written before the issue's first cycle — the criterion-readiness confirmation — carries `cycle 0`. Record entries (`preflight-local-checks`) are level-3 headings and carry no identifier.

| Writer | Namespace |
|---|---|
| Orchestrator | `O` |
| Advisor | `A` |
| Pre-protocol legacy entries (readable, never issued) | `E` |
| Legacy facilitator-delegate entries (readable, never issued) | `F` |

This table is the mapping's only documentary home; other documents cite it rather than restate it.

- **Identifier collision**. Two entries can share an identifier — entries written before this protocol, or a heading appended in error; they stay as they are. A citation that resolves to more than one entry is ambiguous. An ambiguous citation is not resolved — it is re-derived. The reader treats the cited decision as **unrecorded** and re-establishes it from its own grounds, instead of picking whichever colliding entry looks intended. The re-derivation is then appended as a new entry that names the ambiguous identifier it supersedes — the append-only rule is satisfied by adding the disambiguating record, never by editing the colliding pair. A reader that resolves a supersession by identifier (`scripts/gate/security-checklist.sh`) displaces every earlier entry it counts that the named identifier matches — never an operator entry by an advisor's — so a re-deriving entry written by the colliding entries' own authority is the one that stands.

## Decision-point entries

**Advisor decisions and operator overrides.** A decision point is answered first by the advisor
([`role-contracts.md`](role-contracts.md) > Advisor): an `A<n>` entry under the authority
`advisor decision`, carrying a `- Record:` line to the advisor's answer file
(`.autoflow/{repo-key}-issue-{N}/issue-{N}-advisor-<ID>.md`) and the marker and fields its kind requires below. Only the
advisor writes that authority or an `A` heading, and the advisor never writes `operator decision` or
an `O` / `F` / `E` heading — the gate hook denies both
([`role-contracts.md`](role-contracts.md) > Advisor > *Independence*). The operator reviews the
advisor's entries at the retry stage and may override one: the orchestrator — the main session, the
only writer the gate hook admits for an `O` entry or the `operator decision` authority — records the
override as an `O<n>` entry under the authority `operator decision`, with the same marker and fields
and an `- Overrides: A<n>` line. An override supersedes the advisor's entry without a new verified
fact — the operator's authority is the ground, the one supersession the no-re-litigation rule admits
besides the verified-error exception; an advisor never supersedes an operator entry.

**Replacement is explicit.** An entry is never edited to change a decision — the gate hook keeps the
ledger append-only ([`role-contracts.md`](role-contracts.md) > Advisor > *Independence*). A later
entry replaces an earlier one only by naming it: `- Supersedes: <id>` (the same authority, on a new
verified fact or the verified-error exception) or `- Overrides: A<n>` (the operator over the
advisor). Two standing entries on the same subject whose conclusions disagree, with neither naming
the other, are a **conflict**: nothing is settled by recency, and the conflict is resolved by a new
entry — the advisor's, naming the entries it resolves, unless an operator entry is among them, which
only the operator replaces. The same conclusion recorded twice is not a conflict. An identifier two entries
already share is read as *Identifier collision* above says, never repaired by editing either entry.

**Acceptance-criterion decisions** (`[ac-decision]`). Changing an issue's acceptance **content** is
never the design's or a working role's: the **advisor** decides it first and the **operator** may
override at the retry stage ([`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) > Rule Scope, principle 1); choosing how a
criterion is *verified* is the design's, provided the row states its reason, which the external
reviewer then judges at HANDOFF (the three-tier guard — [`units/design.md`](units/design.md) >
*Report routing*). A content change reaches the advisor from wherever it surfaces: the ARCHITECT design
unit's `## Decision requests` section, before GATE:PLAN; a problem the BUILD unit meets and raises in
its report; or a gate recommendation that records a criterion defect, or whose
triage hits the acceptance-criterion pause criterion ([`units/design.md`](units/design.md) > *Report routing*,
[`units/completion-evaluation.md`](units/completion-evaluation.md) > *Recommendation triage*). The change excludes, revises or splits a criterion, or adds one. The
answer is recorded as one entry per decided AC, in the same trailing-marker grammar:
the heading `## A<n> — <title> (cycle <C>, <PHASE>) [ac-decision]` (an override: `## O<n> — …`),
`<PHASE>` being the phase the change surfaced in, followed by the entry's own `- AC: <ac id>` line (for
an added criterion, the id it takes), a `- Disposition:` line valued `excluded` / `revised` / `split` /
`added`, and the ordinary Decision / Grounds / Authority lines with the authority value
`advisor decision` (an override: `operator decision`).

**A criterion can be wrong; from ARCHITECT on, the work tests it**. DIAGNOSE takes the criteria as written — it
analyzes the problem as the issue states it and runs no test of the criteria of its own. That says how
DIAGNOSE works, not when a defect may be raised: a defect observed as a fact is raised wherever it is
observed, a gate before ARCHITECT included. From ARCHITECT on — the design, the build
and every gate after them — a criterion is a hypothesis the work tests, not a truth the
work is bent to fit: wherever the work and a criterion disagree, *is the criterion wrong?* is one of the
answers the judgment weighs, beside *how is it satisfied?* A criterion is **defective** when (a) a fact
it presumes does not hold — a device, a phase or a state it takes for granted; or (b) the scope it draws does not fit the problem — too
narrow, when the same cause reaches past what it names, and the question is then whether the issue saw
the problem as local and the approach itself must change, not only whether to include the rest (a
widening: `revised` / `added`); or too wide, when it binds in a problem separate from this issue (a
split: `split` / `excluded`). A defect so judged is raised as a decision point — the advisor first;
it is never resolved by keeping the criterion's letter. One signal of a defect: a document has to add a rule the criterion did
not state in order to keep the criterion's letter. This paragraph is the principle's single home;
the unit documents and agent definitions cite it.

The marker sits at the **end** of the heading. The authority over an acceptance criterion maps to
these literals and nothing else: the entry's authority **value** is `advisor decision` on an `A<n>`
entry or `operator decision` on an `O<n>` entry, and the entry is **located** by the `[ac-decision]`
heading marker. The two gate backstops key on the marker. When the entries for one AC disagree, an operator entry wins. When the
disposition is `revised`, `split` or `added`, the analysis report's acceptance-criterion table
(`.autoflow/{repo-key}-issue-{N}/issue-{N}-analysis.md`) is edited to
match before re-entry, and this entry is the record of who authorized the edit. An `added` entry
covers no difference in either gate backstop: the criterion it adds is owed its verification-design
row and its discharging site like any other.

**Security-checklist decisions** (`[checklist-decision]`). The security checklist AUDIT scores
against is the target's own, declared at `.claude/autoflow.local.json` > `audit.security_checklist`,
and a cycle's AUDIT reads it as of the cycle's base commit ([`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) > Rule Scope, principle 1). Changing it inside a cycle — the file, or the
declaration that points at it — is never the cycle's own to accept: the **advisor** decides first
and the **operator** may override. When `scripts/gate/security-checklist.sh status` reports the
change at AUDIT entry, the orchestrator spawns the advisor, and the answer is recorded in the same
trailing-marker grammar: the heading `## A<n> — <title> (cycle <C>, AUDIT) [checklist-decision]` (an
override: `## O<n> — …`), followed by a `- Checklist:` line (the declared path at HEAD, or `none` when
the declaration is dropped), a `- Blob:` line (the `git rev-parse HEAD:<path>` of the approved
version, or `none`), a `- Disposition:` line valued `accepted` / `rejected`, and the ordinary
Decision / Grounds / Authority lines with the authority value `advisor decision` (an override:
`operator decision`), plus the `- Supersedes:` / `- Overrides:` line when it replaces an entry. The
script counts an entry only when its Decision and Grounds lines are non-empty, its Disposition is
`accepted` or `rejected`, and its Authority matches its namespace (`advisor decision` on `A<n>`,
`operator decision` on `O<n>`), and only while its Checklist and Blob equal HEAD's, so a later edit to
the checklist is a new change owed its own decision. An entry stands unless a later counted entry
replaces it by name (*Replacement is explicit* above; an advisor entry never replaces an operator
entry). The standing entries decide only when they agree: all `accepted` → the change is covered; all
`rejected` → it is not, and the change is reverted before AUDIT; both → a conflict, reported as
`conflict=<ids>` on an undecided (exit `3`) record and resolved by a new entry, never by recency.

**Criterion-readiness confirmations** (`[criterion-ready]`). Before an issue's first `new-issue`
cycle, its acceptance criteria are reviewed outside the cycle and the operator confirms them
([`criterion-review.md`](criterion-review.md)). Outside a cycle there is no forward path for the
advisor's first judgment to keep moving, so the confirmation is the **operator's** directly — the
same authority over acceptance content as an override ([`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) > Rule Scope,
principle 1). It is recorded in the trailing-marker grammar: the heading
`## O<n> — <title> (cycle 0, CRITERION-REVIEW) [criterion-ready]`, followed by a `- Decision:`
line, a `- Record:` line (the repository-relative path of the review record), an
`- Issue body sha256:` line (the value `scripts/preflight/criterion-ready.sh hash --issue N` prints
for the body as confirmed), and the ordinary Grounds and Authority lines with the authority value
`operator decision`. No `A<n>` entry carries the marker. `scripts/preflight/criterion-ready.sh
status` reads the **last** entry carrying the marker and counts it only when it is an `O` entry
under `operator decision`, its record exists and its sha256 equals the issue body's now; an edit to
the body is confirmed by a new entry, never by editing this one. PREFLIGHT reads that status in
`new-issue` mode ([`units/preparation.md`](units/preparation.md) > Stop conditions > *Criterion
readiness*); nothing inside a cycle reads the entry, and a criterion change inside a cycle stays an
`[ac-decision]`.
